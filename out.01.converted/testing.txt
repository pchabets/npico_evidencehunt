The _ _ O

Consequently, _ _ O

The _ _ O

The _ _ O

Following _ _ O
randomization _ _ O
of _ _ O

the _ _ O

terminated _ _ O
due _ _ O
to _ _ O

UE _ _ O

was _ _ O
detected _ _ O
in _ _ O
18 _ _ O

(29.0%), _ _ O
and _ _ O
it _ _ O
was _ _ O
more _ _ O

After _ _ O

Takotsubo _ _ O
Syndrome(TTS), _ _ O
contrary _ _ O
to _ _ O
historical _ _ O
reports, _ _ O
is _ _ O
now _ _ O
increasingly _ _ O
recognised _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O

with _ _ O
substantial _ _ O
mortality _ _ O
and _ _ O
morbidity, _ _ O
both _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
short- _ _ O

long-term. _ _ O
Although _ _ O
TTS _ _ O
is _ _ O
often _ _ O
precipitated _ _ O
by _ _ O
a _ _ O
catecholamine _ _ O
pulse, _ _ O
in-hospital _ _ O
hypotension _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
common _ _ O
occurrence, _ _ O
increasing _ _ O
the _ _ O
risk _ _ O
of _ _ O
mortality. _ _ O
Furthermore, _ _ O
despite _ _ O
the _ _ O
transient _ _ O
catecholamine _ _ O
stimulus, _ _ O
there _ _ O
is _ _ O
increasing _ _ O
evidence _ _ O
that _ _ O
there _ _ O
are _ _ O

long _ _ O

to _ _ O
limit _ _ O
the _ _ O
extent _ _ O
of _ _ O
initial _ _ O
myocardial _ _ O
injury, _ _ O
and _ _ O
to _ _ O
accelerate _ _ O
recovery _ _ O
in _ _ O
TTS _ _ O
is _ _ O
therefore _ _ O
justified. _ _ O
However _ _ O
to _ _ O

there _ _ O
has _ _ O

a _ _ O

The _ _ O
rationale _ _ O
for _ _ O

agents _ _ O
is _ _ O
related _ _ O
to _ _ O
their _ _ O

A _ _ O

Gefitinib _ _ O
and _ _ O
erlotinib _ _ O
are _ _ O

for _ _ O

patients _ _ O
with _ _ O

However, _ _ O

of _ _ O
epidermal _ _ O
growth _ _ O
factor _ _ O
receptor-tyrosine _ _ O

inhibitors _ _ O
in _ _ O
older _ _ O
patients _ _ O
is _ _ O
difficult, _ _ O
owing _ _ O
to _ _ O
potential _ _ O
adverse _ _ O
events. _ _ O
Hence, _ _ O
dose _ _ O
reduction _ _ O
or _ _ O
treatment _ _ O
discontinuation _ _ O
is _ _ O
often _ _ O
required. _ _ O
We _ _ O
investigated _ _ O
the _ _ O
efficacy _ _ B-Outcome
of _ _ O
low-dose _ _ O
first-line _ _ O
erlotinib _ _ O
and _ _ O
its _ _ O
effects _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
quality _ _ O
of _ _ O

A _ _ O

was _ _ O
carried _ _ O

with _ _ O
epidermal _ _ O
growth _ _ O
factor _ _ O
receptor-mutant _ _ O
non-small _ _ O

lung _ _ O
cancer. _ _ O
Initially, _ _ O
100 _ _ O
mg/day _ _ O
erlotinib _ _ O
was _ _ O
administered _ _ O
orally; _ _ O
if _ _ O
well _ _ O
tolerated, _ _ O
it _ _ O
was _ _ O
increased _ _ O
to _ _ O
150 _ _ O
mg/day. _ _ O
The _ _ O
primary _ _ O
end-point _ _ O
was _ _ O
progression-free _ _ O
survival, _ _ O
and _ _ O
secondary _ _ O
end-points _ _ O
were _ _ O
the _ _ O

overall _ _ O
survival _ _ O
and _ _ O
change _ _ O
in _ _ O
quality _ _ O
of _ _ O
life _ _ O
(Care _ _ O

The _ _ O
median _ _ O
progression-free _ _ O
survival _ _ O
was _ _ O
17.8 _ _ O
months, _ _ O
response _ _ O
rate _ _ O
was _ _ O
63.6% _ _ O
and _ _ O
median _ _ O
overall _ _ O
survival _ _ O
was _ _ O
27.8 _ _ O

The _ _ O
change _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
quality _ _ O
of _ _ O
life _ _ O
after _ _ O
6 _ _ O
weeks _ _ O
was _ _ O
assessed _ _ O
in _ _ O
72.7% _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
patients. _ _ O
Fatigue, _ _ O
pain, _ _ O
anxiety _ _ O
and _ _ O
deterioration _ _ O
in _ _ O

activities _ _ O
were _ _ O
found _ _ O
in _ _ O
at _ _ O
least _ _ O
40% _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
patients. _ _ O
Despite _ _ O
the _ _ O
therapeutic _ _ O
effect _ _ O
of _ _ O
100 _ _ O
mg/day _ _ O
erlotinib, _ _ O
many _ _ O
patients _ _ O
required _ _ O
dose _ _ O
reduction, _ _ O
and _ _ O
in _ _ O
some, _ _ O
the _ _ O
quality _ _ O
of _ _ O

could _ _ O

with _ _ O

(GISTs). _ _ O
However, _ _ O
this _ _ O
dosing _ _ O

requires _ _ O
frequent _ _ O
dose _ _ O
reduction, _ _ O

For _ _ O
all _ _ O

evaluated _ _ O
before _ _ O

were _ _ O

and _ _ O
objective _ _ O
evaluation _ _ O
of _ _ O

Stabilometric _ _ O
parameters _ _ O

were _ _ O

Regarding _ _ O
the _ _ O
stabilometric _ _ O
parameters, _ _ O
Group _ _ O

obtained _ _ O
a _ _ O
statistically _ _ O

Vocal _ _ O
parameters _ _ O
(VHI, _ _ O

were _ _ O
statistically _ _ O
different _ _ O
between _ _ O
the _ _ O
two _ _ O
groups _ _ O
(p _ _ O

with _ _ O
a _ _ O

improvement _ _ O
in _ _ O
Group _ _ O
