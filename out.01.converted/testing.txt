limitations. _ _ O
First, _ _ O
we _ _ O
found _ _ O
that _ _ O
the _ _ O
intervention _ _ O
was _ _ O
still _ _ O
being _ _ O
delivered _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
prespecified _ _ O
primary _ _ O
outcome _ _ O
point, _ _ O
and _ _ O
this _ _ O
fed _ _ O
into _ _ O
the _ _ O
design _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
main _ _ O
trial _ _ O
where _ _ O
a _ _ O
primary _ _ O
outcome _ _ O
of _ _ O
3 _ _ O
months _ _ O
is _ _ O
now _ _ O
collected. _ _ O
Second, _ _ O
this _ _ O
was _ _ O
a _ _ O
pilot _ _ O
trial _ _ O
and _ _ O
was _ _ O
not _ _ O
designed _ _ O
to _ _ O
test _ _ O
between-group _ _ O
differences _ _ O
with _ _ O
high _ _ O
levels _ _ O
of _ _ O
statistical _ _ O
power. _ _ O
Type _ _ O
2 _ _ O
errors _ _ O
are _ _ O
likely _ _ O
to _ _ O
have _ _ O
occurred, _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
larger _ _ O
trial _ _ O
is _ _ O
now _ _ O
underway _ _ O
to _ _ O
test _ _ O
for _ _ O
robust _ _ O
effects _ _ O
and _ _ O
replicate _ _ O
signals _ _ O
of _ _ O
effectiveness _ _ O
in _ _ O
important _ _ O
secondary _ _ O
outcomes _ _ O
such _ _ O
as _ _ O
loneliness. _ _ O
In _ _ O
this _ _ O
study, _ _ O
we _ _ O
observed _ _ O
that _ _ O
BA _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
credible _ _ O
intervention _ _ O
to _ _ O
mitigate _ _ O
the _ _ O
psychological _ _ O
impacts _ _ O
of _ _ O
COVID-19 _ _ O
isolation _ _ O
for _ _ O
older _ _ O
adults. _ _ O
We _ _ O
demonstrated _ _ O
that _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
feasible _ _ O
to _ _ O
undertake _ _ O
a _ _ O
trial _ _ O
of _ _ O
BA. _ _ O
The _ _ O
intervention _ _ O
can _ _ O
be _ _ O
delivered _ _ O
remotely _ _ O
and _ _ O
at _ _ O
scale, _ _ O
but _ _ O
should _ _ O
be _ _ O
reserved _ _ O
for _ _ O
older _ _ O
adults _ _ O
with _ _ O
evidence _ _ O
of _ _ O
depressive _ _ O
symptoms. _ _ O
The _ _ O
significant _ _ O
reduction _ _ O
in _ _ O
loneliness _ _ O
is _ _ O
unlikely _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
a _ _ O
chance _ _ O

(overall _ _ O

The _ _ O

The _ _ O

of _ _ O
this _ _ O

to _ _ O

participated _ _ I-Intervention
in _ _ I-Intervention
a _ _ I-Intervention
virtual _ _ I-Intervention
dementia _ _ I-Intervention
experience. _ _ I-Intervention
Both _ _ O
groups _ _ O
experienced _ _ O
improved _ _ O

toward _ _ O
people _ _ O
with _ _ O

increased _ _ O

improved _ _ O

for _ _ O

Appendiceal _ _ O
transection _ _ O
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
most _ _ O
critical _ _ O
part _ _ O
of _ _ O
laparoscopic _ _ O
appendectomy _ _ O
(LAPPE). _ _ O
The _ _ O
aim _ _ O
of _ _ O
our _ _ O

was _ _ O
to _ _ O
evaluate _ _ O
post-operative _ _ B-Outcome

This _ _ O

a _ _ O

clinical _ _ O
study _ _ O
comparing _ _ O
different _ _ O
techniques _ _ O
of _ _ O

in _ _ O
patients _ _ O
with _ _ O
acute _ _ O
appendicitis _ _ O
during _ _ O
the _ _ O
study _ _ O
period _ _ O
(18 _ _ O
months). _ _ O
The _ _ O

were _ _ O

one _ _ O
of _ _ O
three _ _ O

- _ _ O
endoloop, _ _ B-Intervention
hem-o-lok _ _ I-Intervention

and _ _ I-Intervention
the _ _ I-Intervention
stapler. _ _ I-Intervention
In _ _ O
total, _ _ O
120 _ _ O
patients _ _ O
were _ _ O
enrolled _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
study. _ _ O
The _ _ O
shortest _ _ O
operative _ _ O
time _ _ O
was _ _ O
noted _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
hem-o-lok _ _ O
arm _ _ O
(37.3 _ _ O
minutes); _ _ O
mean _ _ O
length _ _ O
of _ _ O
hospital _ _ O
stay _ _ O
(3.7 _ _ O
days) _ _ O
was _ _ O
comparable _ _ O
in _ _ O
all _ _ O
study _ _ O
arms. _ _ O
Postoperative _ _ O
morbidity _ _ O
was _ _ O
6.6%; _ _ O
all _ _ O
recorded _ _ O
complications _ _ O
were _ _ O
SSIs _ _ O
(Surgical _ _ O
Site _ _ O
Infections). _ _ O
The _ _ O
number _ _ O
of _ _ O
postoperative _ _ O
complications _ _ O
was _ _ O
comparable _ _ O
in _ _ O
all _ _ O
study _ _ O
arms. _ _ O
Mean _ _ O
direct _ _ O
costs _ _ O
of _ _ O
laparoscopic _ _ O
appendectomy _ _ O
were _ _ O
lowest _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
hem-o-lok _ _ O
arm. _ _ O
According _ _ O
to _ _ O
our _ _ O
findings, _ _ O
LAPPE _ _ O
is _ _ O
not _ _ O
a _ _ O
profit _ _ O
making _ _ O
surgery _ _ O
irrespective _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
type _ _ O
of _ _ O
appendiceal _ _ O
transection _ _ O
(mean _ _ O
profit _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
study _ _ O
patients _ _ O
was _ _ O
CZK _ _ O
-4019). _ _ O
The _ _ O
rate _ _ O
of _ _ O
postoperative _ _ O
complications _ _ O
was _ _ O
similar _ _ O
for _ _ O
all _ _ O
the _ _ O
technical _ _ O
modifications _ _ O
of _ _ O
appendiceal _ _ O
stump _ _ O
closure. _ _ O
As _ _ O
indicated _ _ O
by _ _ O
the _ _ O
study _ _ O
outcomes, _ _ O
hem-o-lok _ _ O
clips _ _ O
have _ _ O
the _ _ O
potential _ _ O
of _ _ O
becoming _ _ O
the _ _ O
method _ _ O
of _ _ O
choice _ _ O
in _ _ O
securing _ _ O

during _ _ O

Most _ _ O

have _ _ O
limited _ _ O
disease _ _ O
that _ _ O

with _ _ O

However, _ _ O

The _ _ O

During _ _ O

Therefore, _ _ O
apparent _ _ O

is _ _ O
due _ _ O

(8.2% _ _ O

pnon-inferiority<0.001). _ _ O
The _ _ O

between _ _ O
the _ _ O

was _ _ O
confirmed _ _ O
at _ _ O
two-year _ _ O

(11.6% _ _ O

with _ _ O

in _ _ O

(1.8% _ _ O

(1.6% _ _ O

and _ _ O
major _ _ O
bleeding _ _ O
(3.3% _ _ O
vs _ _ O
4.0%, _ _ O
p=0.46). _ _ O
The _ _ O
results _ _ O
show _ _ O
that, _ _ O
among _ _ O
ACS _ _ O
patients _ _ O
treated _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O

three _ _ O
months _ _ O
is _ _ O
non-inferior _ _ O
to _ _ O
12 _ _ O

of _ _ O
DAPT. _ _ O
However, _ _ O
given _ _ O
the _ _ O

and _ _ O
ST _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O

should _ _ O

until _ _ O

Forty-two _ _ O

In _ _ O
22 _ _ O

systemic _ _ O
doxycycline _ _ O
was _ _ O
used, _ _ O
and _ _ O
in _ _ O

has _ _ O
lesions _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O

One _ _ O
patient _ _ O
exhibited _ _ O
an _ _ O
atypical _ _ O
rash, _ _ O
which _ _ O
was _ _ O
diagnosed _ _ O
as _ _ O
a _ _ O
granulomatous _ _ O
follicular _ _ O

Xerosis _ _ O
was _ _ O
present _ _ O
in _ _ O
two _ _ O
cases, _ _ O
and _ _ O
paronychia, _ _ O
pyogenic _ _ O
granuloma, _ _ O
trichomegaly, _ _ O
and _ _ O
madarosis _ _ O
were _ _ O
observed _ _ O
in _ _ O
one _ _ O
patient _ _ O
each. _ _ O
The _ _ O
patients _ _ O
who _ _ O
developed _ _ O
an _ _ O
acneiform _ _ O
rash _ _ O
were _ _ O
treated _ _ O
with _ _ O
topical _ _ O
and _ _ O
systemic _ _ O
antibiotics, _ _ O
light _ _ O
keratolytics, _ _ O
and _ _ O
emollients. _ _ O
The _ _ O
skin _ _ O
side _ _ O
effects _ _ O
of _ _ O
all _ _ O
patients _ _ O
were _ _ O
mild _ _ O
to _ _ O
moderate, _ _ O
and _ _ O
all _ _ O
patients _ _ O
completed _ _ O
the _ _ O
chemotherapy _ _ O
process. _ _ O
An _ _ O
acneiform _ _ O
skin _ _ O
rash _ _ O
and _ _ O
other _ _ O
dermatological _ _ O
side _ _ O

To _ _ O

these _ _ O
side _ _ O
effects, _ _ O
emollients, _ _ O
topical _ _ O
steroids, _ _ O
and _ _ O
local, _ _ O

antibiotics _ _ O
are _ _ O
recommended. _ _ O
Clindamycin _ _ O
may _ _ O
be _ _ O

as _ _ O
a _ _ O
