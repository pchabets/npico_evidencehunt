Hence, _ _ O

Seventy-six _ _ O

The _ _ O

a _ _ O

Recent _ _ O
clinical _ _ O

that _ _ O
lacosamide, _ _ O
which _ _ O
blocks _ _ O
sodium _ _ O
channels _ _ O
in _ _ O
a _ _ O

manner, _ _ O
attenuates _ _ O

however, _ _ O
only _ _ O
a _ _ O
subgroup _ _ O
of _ _ O
these _ _ O
patients _ _ O
responded _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O

that _ _ O
