A _ _ O

to _ _ O

of _ _ O

More _ _ O

a _ _ O

social-contact-based _ _ O

intervention _ _ O
in _ _ O
increasing _ _ O

intentions _ _ O
among _ _ O
veterans. _ _ O
We _ _ O
hypothesized _ _ O
that _ _ O
the _ _ O
video-based _ _ O
intervention _ _ O
would _ _ O
increase _ _ O
treatment-seeking _ _ O
intentions _ _ O
more _ _ O
than _ _ O

either _ _ O
a _ _ O

the _ _ O

a _ _ O
veteran _ _ O
previously _ _ O
diagnosed _ _ O

described _ _ O
his _ _ O
symptom _ _ O
reactivation _ _ O
by _ _ O
Covid-19, _ _ O
his _ _ O
barriers _ _ O
to _ _ O
care, _ _ O
and _ _ O
how _ _ O
therapy _ _ O
helped _ _ O
him _ _ O
to _ _ O
cope. _ _ O
Assessments _ _ O
were _ _ O
conducted _ _ O
at _ _ O
baseline, _ _ O
postintervention, _ _ O
and _ _ O
at _ _ O
14- _ _ O

30-day _ _ O
follow-ups. _ _ O
A _ _ O
total _ _ O
of _ _ O
91 _ _ O
(53%) _ _ O
veterans _ _ O
reported _ _ O
high _ _ O
levels _ _ O
of _ _ O
clinical _ _ O
symptoms, _ _ O
especially _ _ O
those _ _ O
self-reporting _ _ O

The _ _ O
brief _ _ O
video-based _ _ O
intervention _ _ O
yielded _ _ O
greater _ _ O
increase _ _ O
in _ _ O
treatment-seeking _ _ O
intentions _ _ O
among _ _ O

Within _ _ O
the _ _ O

an _ _ O
increase _ _ O
in _ _ O
treatment-seeking _ _ O
intentions _ _ O
from _ _ O
baseline _ _ O
to _ _ O

only, _ _ O

a _ _ O
more _ _ O

effect, _ _ O
from _ _ O
baseline _ _ O
to _ _ O
Day _ _ O
14. _ _ O
Surveyed _ _ O
veterans _ _ O
reported _ _ O
high _ _ O
symptoms _ _ O
levels. _ _ O
A _ _ O
brief _ _ O
video _ _ O
intervention _ _ O
increased _ _ O
treatment-seeking _ _ O
intention, _ _ O
likely _ _ O
through _ _ O
identification _ _ O
and _ _ O

with _ _ O
the _ _ O

This _ _ O
easily _ _ O

video-based _ _ O
intervention _ _ O
has _ _ O
the _ _ O
potential _ _ O
to _ _ O
increase _ _ O
likelihood _ _ O

and _ _ O
the _ _ O

TTNS _ _ O
every _ _ O

for _ _ O
3 _ _ O

The _ _ O

showed _ _ O
a _ _ O
statistically _ _ O

improvement _ _ O
in _ _ O

as _ _ O

The _ _ O

(P<0.05) _ _ O
and _ _ O
with _ _ O
no _ _ O

It _ _ O
was _ _ O
found _ _ O
that _ _ O
the _ _ O
improved _ _ O
quality _ _ O
of _ _ O
life _ _ O
parameters _ _ O
and _ _ O
the _ _ O

were _ _ O
more _ _ O

significant _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
treatment _ _ O
with _ _ O
oxybutynin _ _ O

than _ _ O

(P<0.001). _ _ O
Our _ _ O
recommendation _ _ O
for _ _ O
the _ _ O

of _ _ O

is _ _ O
oxybutynin _ _ O
in _ _ O

If _ _ O
a _ _ O
patient _ _ O
can _ _ O
not _ _ O
tolerate _ _ O
anticholinergic _ _ O
drugs, _ _ O
daily _ _ O
TTNS _ _ O
is _ _ O
recommended _ _ O

According _ _ O

significantly _ _ O

that _ _ O

occurred _ _ O
both _ _ O
