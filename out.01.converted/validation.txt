In _ _ O

rare _ _ O
(one _ _ O

The _ _ O

decreased _ _ O
significantly _ _ O
(P _ _ O

for _ _ O
the _ _ O

Takotsubo _ _ O
Syndrome(TTS), _ _ O
contrary _ _ O
to _ _ O
historical _ _ O
reports, _ _ O
is _ _ O
now _ _ O
increasingly _ _ O
recognised _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
associated _ _ O
with _ _ O
substantial _ _ O
mortality _ _ O
and _ _ O
morbidity, _ _ O
both _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
short- _ _ O
and _ _ O
long-term. _ _ O
Although _ _ O
TTS _ _ O
is _ _ O
often _ _ O
precipitated _ _ O
by _ _ O
a _ _ O
catecholamine _ _ O
pulse, _ _ O
in-hospital _ _ O
hypotension _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
common _ _ O
occurrence, _ _ O
increasing _ _ O
the _ _ O
risk _ _ O
of _ _ O
mortality. _ _ O
Furthermore, _ _ O
despite _ _ O
the _ _ O
transient _ _ O
catecholamine _ _ O
stimulus, _ _ O
there _ _ O
is _ _ O
increasing _ _ O
evidence _ _ O
that _ _ O
there _ _ O
are _ _ O
significant _ _ O
long _ _ O

sequelae, _ _ O
including _ _ O
persistently _ _ O
impaired _ _ O
left _ _ O
ventricular(LV) _ _ O
systolic _ _ O
dysfunction, _ _ O
myocardial _ _ O

with _ _ O

well _ _ O
as _ _ O
persistent _ _ O

of _ _ O

to _ _ O

the _ _ O
extent _ _ O
of _ _ O
initial _ _ O
myocardial _ _ O
injury, _ _ O
and _ _ O
to _ _ O
accelerate _ _ O
recovery _ _ O
in _ _ O
TTS _ _ O
is _ _ O
therefore _ _ O
justified. _ _ O
However _ _ O
to _ _ O
date, _ _ O
there _ _ O
has _ _ O
been _ _ O
a _ _ O

The _ _ O
rationale _ _ O
for _ _ O

agents _ _ O
is _ _ O
related _ _ O
to _ _ O
their _ _ O
effects _ _ O
