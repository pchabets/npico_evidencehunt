not _ _ O

Surveyed _ _ O

A _ _ O

through _ _ O

Methods: _ _ O
In _ _ O
this _ _ O

40 _ _ O

the _ _ O
skin _ _ O
properties _ _ O
(oily _ _ O

The _ _ O
clinical _ _ O
evaluation _ _ O
of _ _ O

An _ _ O

In _ _ O

However, _ _ O

a _ _ O

in _ _ O

from _ _ O

2020 _ _ O
to _ _ O
August _ _ O
2020. _ _ O
Based _ _ O
on _ _ O
working _ _ O
methods _ _ O
during _ _ O
the _ _ O
pandemic, _ _ O
workers _ _ O
were _ _ O
categorized _ _ O
into _ _ O
the _ _ O
office _ _ B-Control

(n _ _ O

and _ _ O
telework _ _ B-Intervention

(n _ _ O

we _ _ O

The _ _ O

the _ _ O

During _ _ O

teleworkers _ _ O
experienced _ _ O
more _ _ O

67.0% _ _ O

the _ _ O

Approximately _ _ O

they _ _ O

in _ _ O
both _ _ O
working _ _ O

Work-family _ _ O

was _ _ O
more _ _ O
pronounced _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
TT _ _ O

than _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
two _ _ O

Only _ _ O
13.2% _ _ O

did _ _ O
not _ _ O
experience _ _ O
any _ _ O
stress _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O

all _ _ O

In _ _ B-O
