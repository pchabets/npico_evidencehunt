When _ _ O

in _ _ O
the _ _ O

by _ _ I-Patient
using _ _ I-Patient
an _ _ I-Patient

of _ _ I-Patient
COPD _ _ I-Patient
(induced _ _ I-Patient
by _ _ I-Patient
chronic _ _ I-Patient

to _ _ I-Patient

(CS)) _ _ I-Patient
and _ _ I-Patient
clinical _ _ I-Patient
data _ _ I-Patient
obtained _ _ I-Patient
from _ _ I-Patient
Exo-d-MAPPS-treated _ _ I-Patient
COPD _ _ I-Patient
patients. _ _ I-Patient
Exo-d-MAPPS _ _ O
contains _ _ O
a _ _ O
high _ _ O
concentration _ _ O
of _ _ O
immunomodulatory _ _ O
factors _ _ O
which _ _ O
are _ _ O
capable _ _ O
of _ _ O
attenuating _ _ O
chronic _ _ O
airway _ _ O
inflammation, _ _ O
including _ _ O
soluble _ _ O
TNF _ _ O

receptor _ _ O
antagonist, _ _ O
and _ _ O
soluble _ _ O
receptor _ _ O
for _ _ O
advanced _ _ O
glycation _ _ O
end _ _ O
products. _ _ O
Accordingly, _ _ O
Exo-d-MAPPS _ _ O
significantly _ _ O
improved _ _ O
respiratory _ _ O
function, _ _ O
downregulated _ _ O
serum _ _ O
levels _ _ O
of _ _ O
inflammatory _ _ O
cytokines _ _ O
(TNF-α, _ _ O
IL-1β, _ _ O
IL-12, _ _ O
and _ _ O
IFN-γ), _ _ O
increased _ _ O
serum _ _ O
concentration _ _ O
of _ _ O
immunosuppressive _ _ O
IL-10, _ _ O
and _ _ O
attenuated _ _ O
chronic _ _ O
airway _ _ O
inflammation _ _ O
in _ _ O
CS-exposed _ _ O
mice. _ _ O
The _ _ O
cellular _ _ O
makeup _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
lungs _ _ O
revealed _ _ O
that _ _ O
Exo-d-MAPPS _ _ O
treatment _ _ O
attenuated _ _ O
the _ _ O
production _ _ O
of _ _ O
inflammatory _ _ O
cytokines _ _ O
in _ _ O
lung-infiltrated _ _ O
macrophages, _ _ O
neutrophils, _ _ O
and _ _ O
natural _ _ O

cells _ _ O
and _ _ O
alleviated _ _ O
the _ _ O
antigen-presenting _ _ O
properties _ _ O
of _ _ O
lung-infiltrated _ _ O
macrophages _ _ O
and _ _ O
dendritic _ _ O
cells _ _ O
(DCs). _ _ O
Additionally, _ _ O
Exo-d-MAPPS _ _ O
promoted _ _ O
the _ _ O
expansion _ _ O
of _ _ O
immunosuppressive _ _ O
IL-10-producing _ _ O
alternatively _ _ O
activated _ _ O
macrophages, _ _ O
regulatory _ _ O
DCs, _ _ O
and _ _ O
CD4+FoxP3+T _ _ O
regulatory _ _ O
cells _ _ O
in _ _ O
inflamed _ _ O
lungs _ _ O
which _ _ O
resulted _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
attenuation _ _ O
of _ _ O
chronic _ _ O
airway _ _ O
inflammation. _ _ O
In _ _ O
a _ _ O
similar _ _ O
manner, _ _ O
as _ _ O
it _ _ O
was _ _ O
observed _ _ O
in _ _ O
an _ _ O
animal _ _ O
model, _ _ O
Exo-d-MAPPS _ _ O
treatment _ _ O
significantly _ _ O
improved _ _ O
the _ _ O
pulmonary _ _ O
status _ _ O
and _ _ O
quality _ _ O
of _ _ O
life _ _ O
of _ _ O
COPD _ _ O
patients. _ _ O
Importantly, _ _ O
Exo-d-MAPPS _ _ O
was _ _ O
well _ _ O
tolerated _ _ O
since _ _ O
none _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
30 _ _ O
COPD _ _ O
patients _ _ O
reported _ _ O
any _ _ O
adverse _ _ O
effects _ _ O
after _ _ O
Exo-d-MAPPS _ _ O
administration. _ _ O
In _ _ B-O

up, _ _ I-O
we _ _ I-O
believe _ _ I-O
that _ _ I-O
Exo-d-MAPPS _ _ I-O
could _ _ I-O

The _ _ B-O

However, _ _ O
the _ _ O

Hence, _ _ O
this _ _ O

the _ _ O

The _ _ O

on _ _ O
the _ _ O

No _ _ O

in _ _ O
its _ _ O

dimensions _ _ O
according _ _ O
to _ _ O

questionnaire. _ _ O
The _ _ O
patients _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O

group _ _ O
experienced _ _ O
more _ _ O
pain _ _ O
during _ _ O

measured _ _ O

Appendiceal _ _ O
transection _ _ O
is _ _ O
the _ _ O
most _ _ O
critical _ _ O
part _ _ O
of _ _ O
laparoscopic _ _ O
appendectomy _ _ O
(LAPPE). _ _ O
The _ _ O

to _ _ O

This _ _ O

clinical _ _ O
study _ _ O
comparing _ _ O

with _ _ O
acute _ _ O
appendicitis _ _ O
during _ _ O
the _ _ O
study _ _ O
period _ _ O
(18 _ _ O

The _ _ O

- _ _ O

stapler. _ _ I-Intervention
In _ _ O
total, _ _ O
120 _ _ O

were _ _ O
enrolled _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
study. _ _ O
The _ _ O
shortest _ _ O
operative _ _ O
time _ _ O
was _ _ O
noted _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
hem-o-lok _ _ O
arm _ _ O
(37.3 _ _ O
minutes); _ _ O
mean _ _ O
length _ _ O
of _ _ O
hospital _ _ O

(3.7 _ _ O

was _ _ O
comparable _ _ O
in _ _ O
all _ _ O

Postoperative _ _ O
morbidity _ _ O
was _ _ O
6.6%; _ _ O
all _ _ O
recorded _ _ O
complications _ _ O
were _ _ O
SSIs _ _ O
(Surgical _ _ O

The _ _ O

costs _ _ O
of _ _ O
laparoscopic _ _ O
appendectomy _ _ O
were _ _ O
lowest _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
hem-o-lok _ _ O
arm. _ _ O
According _ _ O
to _ _ O
our _ _ O
findings, _ _ O
LAPPE _ _ O
is _ _ O
not _ _ O
a _ _ O
profit _ _ O
making _ _ O
surgery _ _ O
irrespective _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
type _ _ O
of _ _ O

transection _ _ O
(mean _ _ O

The _ _ O
rate _ _ O
of _ _ O
postoperative _ _ O

was _ _ O
similar _ _ O
for _ _ O
all _ _ O
the _ _ O
technical _ _ O
modifications _ _ O
of _ _ O

indicated _ _ I-O
by _ _ I-O
the _ _ I-O

53.4% _ _ O

AEs _ _ O
(56.3%, _ _ O

The _ _ O

confirmed _ _ O
at _ _ O

(3.3% _ _ O

The _ _ O

that, _ _ O
among _ _ O

patients _ _ O
treated _ _ O

is _ _ O
non-inferior _ _ O
to _ _ O

in _ _ O

According _ _ O

significantly _ _ O
less _ _ O

in _ _ O
the _ _ O

that _ _ O

resorption _ _ O
occurs _ _ O
in _ _ O

Furthermore, _ _ O

both _ _ O

that _ _ O

significantly _ _ O
prolonged _ _ O
the _ _ O

the _ _ O

although _ _ O
a _ _ O

results _ _ O
were _ _ O

in _ _ O
this _ _ O

(P _ _ O

This _ _ B-O

especially _ _ I-O
in _ _ I-O

models. _ _ I-O
In _ _ O
addition _ _ O
to _ _ O
promising _ _ O
dexamethasone _ _ O
outcomes, _ _ O
using _ _ O
propranolol _ _ O
as _ _ O
the _ _ O

The _ _ O

on _ _ O

This _ _ O

The _ _ O

until _ _ O
the _ _ O

CBT-I _ _ O
could _ _ O
significantly _ _ O
improve _ _ O
insomnia _ _ O

we _ _ O
found _ _ O
that _ _ O

still _ _ O
being _ _ O
delivered _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
prespecified _ _ O
primary _ _ O
outcome _ _ O

and _ _ O
this _ _ O
fed _ _ O
into _ _ O
the _ _ O
design _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
main _ _ O
trial _ _ O
where _ _ O
a _ _ O
primary _ _ O
outcome _ _ O
of _ _ O
3 _ _ O
months _ _ O
is _ _ O
now _ _ O
collected. _ _ O
Second, _ _ O
this _ _ O
was _ _ O
a _ _ O
pilot _ _ O
trial _ _ O
and _ _ O
was _ _ O
not _ _ O
designed _ _ O
to _ _ O
test _ _ O
between-group _ _ O
differences _ _ O
with _ _ O
high _ _ O
levels _ _ O
of _ _ O
statistical _ _ O
power. _ _ O
Type _ _ O
2 _ _ O
errors _ _ O
are _ _ O
likely _ _ O
to _ _ O
have _ _ O
occurred, _ _ O
and _ _ O
a _ _ O
larger _ _ O
trial _ _ O
is _ _ O
now _ _ O
underway _ _ O
to _ _ O
test _ _ O
for _ _ O
robust _ _ O
effects _ _ O
and _ _ O
replicate _ _ O
signals _ _ O
of _ _ O
effectiveness _ _ O
in _ _ O
important _ _ O
secondary _ _ O
outcomes _ _ O
such _ _ O
as _ _ O
loneliness. _ _ O
In _ _ O
this _ _ O
study, _ _ O
we _ _ O
observed _ _ O
that _ _ O
BA _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
credible _ _ O
intervention _ _ O
to _ _ O
mitigate _ _ O
the _ _ O
psychological _ _ O
impacts _ _ O
of _ _ O
COVID-19 _ _ O
isolation _ _ O
for _ _ O
older _ _ O
adults. _ _ O
We _ _ O
demonstrated _ _ O
that _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
feasible _ _ O
to _ _ O
undertake _ _ O
a _ _ O
trial _ _ O
of _ _ O
BA. _ _ O
The _ _ B-O

can _ _ I-O
be _ _ I-O
delivered _ _ I-O
remotely _ _ I-O
and _ _ I-O
at _ _ I-O
scale, _ _ I-O
but _ _ I-O
should _ _ I-O
be _ _ I-O

for _ _ I-O
older _ _ I-O

with _ _ I-O

The _ _ O
significant _ _ O

is _ _ O
unlikely _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
a _ _ O
chance _ _ O

Cognitive _ _ O
(or _ _ O

problems, _ _ O
particularly _ _ O
those _ _ O
affecting _ _ O
memory _ _ O
and _ _ O
attention, _ _ O
are _ _ O
common _ _ O
in _ _ O
people _ _ O
with _ _ O

Multiple _ _ O
sclerosis _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
condition _ _ O
that _ _ O
affects _ _ O
the _ _ O
brain _ _ O
and _ _ O
causes _ _ O
nerve _ _ O
damage. _ _ O
Cognitive _ _ O
rehabilitation _ _ O
can _ _ O
involve: _ _ O
retraining _ _ O
cognitive _ _ O
skills, _ _ O
which _ _ O
are _ _ O
the _ _ O
core _ _ O
skills _ _ O
your _ _ O
brain _ _ O
uses _ _ O
to _ _ O

Cognitive _ _ O
rehabilitation _ _ O
is _ _ O
rarely _ _ O
provided _ _ O
for _ _ O
people _ _ O
with _ _ O
multiple _ _ O
sclerosis. _ _ O
A _ _ O
trial _ _ O
was _ _ O
carried _ _ O
out _ _ O
to _ _ O
determine _ _ O
whether _ _ O
or _ _ O
not _ _ O
providing _ _ O
a _ _ O
group _ _ O
cognitive _ _ O
rehabilitation _ _ O
programme _ _ O
improved _ _ O
quality _ _ O
of _ _ O
life _ _ O
more _ _ O
than _ _ O
usual _ _ O
clinical _ _ O
care, _ _ O
which _ _ O
did _ _ O
not _ _ O
involve _ _ O
any _ _ O
cognitive _ _ O
rehabilitation. _ _ O
The _ _ O
effects _ _ O
on _ _ O
daily _ _ O
memory _ _ O
problems, _ _ O
mood, _ _ O
fatigue _ _ O
and _ _ O
employment _ _ O
were _ _ O
examined _ _ O
and _ _ O
also _ _ O
the _ _ O
cost-effectiveness _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
treatment. _ _ O
A _ _ O
total _ _ O
of _ _ O
449 _ _ O
people _ _ O
with _ _ O
multiple _ _ O
sclerosis _ _ O
took _ _ O
part _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
trial. _ _ O
They _ _ O
all _ _ O
agreed _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
part _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
research _ _ O
trial, _ _ O
had _ _ O
cognitive _ _ O
problems, _ _ O
were _ _ O
aged _ _ O
18–69 _ _ O
years _ _ O
and _ _ O
could _ _ O
travel _ _ O
to _ _ O
attend _ _ O
group _ _ O
sessions. _ _ O
Participants _ _ O
were _ _ O
then _ _ O
allocated _ _ O
to _ _ O
receive _ _ O
cognitive _ _ O
rehabilitation _ _ O
or _ _ O
not, _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
basis _ _ O
of _ _ O
chance _ _ O
(i.e. _ _ O
randomly). _ _ O
All _ _ O
participants _ _ O
were _ _ O
followed _ _ O
up _ _ O
for _ _ O
1 _ _ O
year. _ _ O
Although _ _ O
both _ _ O
groups _ _ O
showed _ _ O
no _ _ O
differences _ _ O
in _ _ O
quality _ _ O
of _ _ O
life _ _ O
after _ _ O
1 _ _ O
year, _ _ O
those _ _ O
who _ _ O
received _ _ O
cognitive _ _ O
rehabilitation _ _ O
had _ _ O
fewer _ _ O
memory _ _ O
problems _ _ O
in _ _ O
daily _ _ O
life _ _ O
and _ _ O
reported _ _ O
better _ _ O
mood _ _ O
than _ _ O
those _ _ O
who _ _ O
received _ _ O
only _ _ O
their _ _ O
usual _ _ O
clinical _ _ O
care. _ _ O
There _ _ O
were _ _ O
no _ _ O
differences _ _ O
in _ _ O
their _ _ O
levels _ _ O
of _ _ O
fatigue _ _ O
or _ _ O
disability, _ _ O
or _ _ O
in _ _ O
employment _ _ O
status. _ _ O
The _ _ O
qualitative _ _ O
results _ _ O
indicated _ _ O
that _ _ O
participants _ _ O
found _ _ O
the _ _ O
intervention _ _ O
useful. _ _ O
Treatment _ _ O
cost _ _ O
slightly _ _ O
less _ _ O
than _ _ O
usual _ _ O
care _ _ O
but _ _ O
had _ _ O
modest _ _ O
benefits. _ _ O
Overall, _ _ B-O
the _ _ I-O
results _ _ I-O
suggest _ _ I-O
that _ _ I-O
there _ _ I-O
may _ _ I-O

of _ _ I-O

can _ _ I-O
be _ _ I-O

It _ _ O
was _ _ O

that _ _ O
the _ _ O
improved _ _ O

with _ _ O

Our _ _ O
recommendation _ _ O
for _ _ O
the _ _ O

If _ _ O
a _ _ O
patient _ _ O
can _ _ O
not _ _ O
tolerate _ _ O
anticholinergic _ _ O
drugs, _ _ O
daily _ _ O
TTNS _ _ O
is _ _ O
recommended _ _ O

The _ _ O
proposed _ _ O

has _ _ O
a _ _ O

The _ _ O

shown _ _ O
that _ _ O
the _ _ O

based _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O

can _ _ O
effectively _ _ O

Consequently, _ _ O
the _ _ O

would _ _ O
improve _ _ O
the _ _ O

of _ _ O

the _ _ O

than _ _ O
the _ _ O

Although _ _ O

Takotsubo _ _ O
Syndrome(TTS), _ _ O
contrary _ _ O
to _ _ O
historical _ _ O
reports, _ _ O
is _ _ O
now _ _ O
increasingly _ _ O
recognised _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
associated _ _ O
with _ _ O
substantial _ _ O
mortality _ _ O
and _ _ O
morbidity, _ _ O
both _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
short- _ _ O
and _ _ O
long-term. _ _ O
Although _ _ O
TTS _ _ O
is _ _ O
often _ _ O
precipitated _ _ O
by _ _ O
a _ _ O
catecholamine _ _ O
pulse, _ _ O
in-hospital _ _ O
hypotension _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
common _ _ O
occurrence, _ _ O
increasing _ _ O
the _ _ O
risk _ _ O
of _ _ O
mortality. _ _ O
Furthermore, _ _ O
despite _ _ O
the _ _ O
transient _ _ O
catecholamine _ _ O
stimulus, _ _ O
there _ _ O
is _ _ O
increasing _ _ O
evidence _ _ O
that _ _ O
there _ _ O
are _ _ O
significant _ _ O
long _ _ O
term _ _ O
sequelae, _ _ O
including _ _ O
persistently _ _ O
impaired _ _ O
left _ _ O
ventricular(LV) _ _ O
systolic _ _ O
dysfunction, _ _ O
myocardial _ _ O
oedema _ _ O
with _ _ O

as _ _ O
well _ _ O
as _ _ O
persistent _ _ O
impairment _ _ O
of _ _ O
quality _ _ O
of _ _ O

A _ _ O

to _ _ O
limit _ _ O
the _ _ O
extent _ _ O
of _ _ O
initial _ _ O
myocardial _ _ O
injury, _ _ O
and _ _ O
to _ _ O
accelerate _ _ O
recovery _ _ O
in _ _ O
TTS _ _ O
is _ _ O
therefore _ _ O
justified. _ _ O
However _ _ O
to _ _ O
date, _ _ O
there _ _ O
has _ _ O
been _ _ O
a _ _ O

The _ _ O

to _ _ O

Chronic _ _ O

An _ _ O
intervention _ _ O
for _ _ O

ear _ _ O

Several _ _ O

are _ _ O
used _ _ O
for _ _ O

particularly _ _ O
the _ _ O

Both _ _ O

However, _ _ O
in _ _ O

initial _ _ O
and _ _ O
final _ _ O
evaluations, _ _ O
only _ _ O
Chinese _ _ O
ear _ _ O

produced _ _ O
statistically _ _ O
significant _ _ O
results. _ _ O
A _ _ O
reduction _ _ O
in _ _ O
physical _ _ O

was _ _ O
observed _ _ O
in _ _ O
both _ _ O
ear _ _ O
acupuncture-treated _ _ O
groups _ _ O
during _ _ O
the _ _ O
intervention _ _ O
period _ _ O
and, _ _ O
although _ _ O
Chinese _ _ O

failed _ _ O
to _ _ O
induce _ _ O
significant _ _ O
changes _ _ O
in _ _ O
tissular _ _ O

at _ _ O
individual _ _ O
time _ _ O
points, _ _ O
a _ _ O
significant _ _ O

Importantly, _ _ O
at _ _ O

point, _ _ O
the _ _ O
mean _ _ O

between _ _ O

revealed _ _ O
a _ _ O

The _ _ O

All _ _ O

that _ _ O
the _ _ O

However, _ _ O
anxiety _ _ O

suggest _ _ O
that _ _ O
rumination _ _ O
increases _ _ O
craving _ _ O
for _ _ O
alcohol _ _ O
and _ _ O
predicts _ _ O
harmful _ _ O

problems. _ _ O
However, _ _ O
the _ _ O
acute _ _ O

of _ _ O
alcohol _ _ O
on _ _ O
rumination _ _ O
have _ _ O
not _ _ O
been _ _ O

It _ _ O
is _ _ O
proposed _ _ O
that _ _ O

In _ _ O

These _ _ B-O

that _ _ I-O
