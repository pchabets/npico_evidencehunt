Adults with treatment-resistant focal (partial-onset) seizures were randomized 2:1 to ESL 1600 or 1200 mg once daily. The primary efficacy endpoint was study exit (meeting predefined exit criteria related to worsening seizure control) versus an historical control group. Other endpoints included change in seizure frequency, responder rate, and tolerability. Endpoints were analyzed for subgroups of patients who received CBZ (or any VGSC inhibitor [VGSCi]) during baseline versus those who received other AEDs. Of 365 patients in the studies, 332 were evaluable for efficacy. The higher risk of study exit in the subgroups that received CBZ (or any VGSCi) during baseline, versus other AEDs, was not statistically significant (hazard ratios were 1.49 for +CBZ vs -CBZ [P = .10] and 1.27 for +VGSCi vs. -VGSCi [P = .33]). Reductions in seizure frequency and responder rates were lower in patients who converted from CBZ or other VGSCi compared with those who converted from other AEDs. There were no notable differences in overall tolerability between subgroups, but the incidence of some adverse events (eg, dizziness, somnolence, nausea) differed between subgroups and/or between treatment periods. Baseline use of CBZ or other major putative VGSC inhibitors did not appear to significantly increase the risk of study exit due to worsening seizure control, or to increase the frequency of side effects when converting to ESL monotherapy. However, bigger improvements in efficacy may be possible in patients converting to ESL monotherapy from an AED regimen that does not include a VGSC inhibitor.", "labels": [[931, 934, "N"], [387, 449, "Patient"], [240, 283, "Intervention"], [321, 350, "Intervention"], [473, 503, "Intervention"], [629, 656, "Control"], [809, 844, "Intervention"], [887, 897, "Control"], [1025, 1043, "Intervention"], [29, 197, "Intervention"], [1068, 1078, "Control"], [964, 1207, "Outcome"], [1303, 1321, "Intervention"], [1361, 1371, "Control"], [1209, 1371, "Outcome_2nd"], [1597, 1647, "Intervention"], [1796, 1825, "Intervention"], [1896, 1925, "Intervention"], [1931, 1984, "Control"], [1373, 1586, "Outcome_2nd"]]}

Seizure diaries were kept throughout the baseline and trial period. A total of 58 patients completed the trial. Anxiety and depression scores were significantly reduced following the light therapy at T3 in both the high- and low-intensity groups. Light therapy resulted in a significant reduction in symptoms of anxiety and depression but we did not find any differences between high- v. low-intensity treatment.

After the failure of first-line diazepam treatment, Chinese adult patients with GCSE were randomized to receive either intravenous phenobarbital (standard doses, low rate) or valproate (standard). Successful treatment was considered when clinical and electroencephalographic seizure activity ceased. Adverse events following treatment, as well as the neurological outcomes at discharge and 3 months later, were also evaluated. Overall, 73 cases were enrolled in the study. Intravenous phenobarbital was successful in 81.1% of patients, and intravenous valproate was successful in 44.4% of patients (p < 0.05). The relapse rate of status epilepticus within 24 h of receiving phenobarbital (6.7%) was significantly lower than that in patients receiving valproate (31.3%), and the total number of adverse events did not differ significantly between the two groups (p > 0.05). In the phenobarbital group, two patients (5.4%) required ventilation and two patients (5.4%) developed serious hypotension. The neurological outcomes of the phenobarbital group were generally better than those of the valproate group; however, no significant differences were observed between phenobarbital and valproate with respect to mortality (8.1 vs. 16.6%) at discharge, or mortality (16.2 vs. 30.5%) and post-symptomatic epilepsy (26.3 vs. 42.8%) at 3-month follow-up. Intravenous phenobarbital appears to be more effective than intravenous valproate for Chinese adult patients with GCSE. The occurrence of serious respiratory depression and hypotension caused by phenobarbital was reduced by decreasing the intravenous infusion rate; however, even at a lower infusion rate than typically used in other institutions, intravenous phenobarbital resulted in more serious adverse events than intravenous valproate.

{"id": 2498, "text": "Valproate is a first-line treatment for patients with newly diagnosed idiopathic generalised or difficult to classify epilepsy, but not for women of child-bearing potential because of teratogenicity. Levetiracetam is increasingly prescribed for these patient populations despite scarcity of evidence of clinical effectiveness or cost-effectiveness. We aimed to compare the long-term clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of levetiracetam compared with valproate in participants with newly diagnosed generalised or unclassifiable epilepsy. We did an open-label, randomised controlled trial to compare levetiracetam with valproate as first-line treatment for patients with generalised or unclassified epilepsy. Adult and paediatric neurology services (69 centres overall) across the UK recruited participants aged 5 years or older (with no upper age limit) with two or more unprovoked generalised or unclassifiable seizures. Participants were randomly allocated (1:1) to receive either levetiracetam or valproate, using a minimisation programme with a random element utilising factors. Participants and investigators were aware of treatment allocation. For participants aged 12 years or older, the initial advised maintenance doses were 500 mg twice per day for levetiracetam and valproate, and for children aged 5-12 years, the initial daily maintenance doses advised were 25 mg/kg for valproate and 40 mg/kg for levetiracetam. All drugs were administered orally. SANAD II was designed to assess the non-inferiority of levetiracetam compared with valproate for the primary outcome time to 12-month remission. The non-inferiority limit was a hazard ratio (HR) of 1·314, which equates to an absolute difference of 10%. A HR greater than 1 indicated that an event was more likely on valproate. All participants were included in the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. Per-protocol (PP) analyses excluded participants with major protocol deviations and those who were subsequently diagnosed as not having epilepsy. Safety analyses included all participants who received one dose of any study drug. This trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry, 30294119 (EudraCt number: 2012-001884-64). 520 participants were recruited between April 30, 2013, and Aug 2, 2016, and followed up for a further 2 years. 260 participants were randomly allocated to receive levetiracetam and 260 participants to receive valproate. The ITT analysis included all participants and the PP analysis included 255 participants randomly allocated to valproate and 254 randomly allocated to levetiracetam. Median age of participants was 13·9 years (range 5·0-94·4), 65% were male and 35% were female, 397 participants had generalised epilepsy, and 123 unclassified epilepsy. Levetiracetam did not meet the criteria for non-inferiority in the ITT analysis of time to 12-month remission (HR 1·19 [95% CI 0·96-1·47]); non-inferiority margin 1·314. The PP analysis showed that the 12-month remission was superior with valproate than with levetiracetam. There were two deaths, one in each group, that were unrelated to trial treatments. Adverse reactions were reported by 96 (37%) participants randomly assigned to valproate and 107 (42%) participants randomly assigned to levetiracetam. Levetiracetam was dominated by valproate in the cost-utility analysis, with a negative incremental net health benefit of -0·040 (95% central range -0·175 to 0·037) and a probability of 0·17 of being cost-effectiveness at a threshold of £20 000 per quality-adjusted life-year. Cost-effectiveness was based on differences between treatment groups in costs and quality-adjusted life-years. Compared with valproate, levetiracetam was found to be neither clinically effective nor cost-effective.

Data from four double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase III studies that had at least one 600 mg/day treatment arm were combined. The common 6-week baseline period was divided into weekly intervals, as was the 12-week post-randomization period. Two methods of analysis were used: logistic regression performed on 50% responder rate and the Hodges-Lehmann estimate on percentage reduction from baseline seizure rate. A simulation-based re-sampling approach was used to determine sufficient sample size. Four weeks of baseline with 3 weeks of treatment were determined to be clinically and statistically sufficient. A reasonable sample size was estimated to be 40-50 patients per group, if a highly efficacious drug was used.

The purpose of this phase III study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety/tolerability of adjunctive BRV in adults with uncontrolled partial-onset (focal) seizures. This was a prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, fixed-dose trial (N01253; NCT00464269). Adults aged 16-70 years with well-characterized partial epilepsy not fully controlled despite treatment with one or two antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) were enrolled. Patients who experienced eight or more partial-onset seizures, whether or not secondarily generalized, during the 8-week prospective baseline period were randomized (1:1:1:1) to receive twice-daily placebo (PBO) or BRV (5, 20, or 50 mg/day) without titration. The primary efficacy endpoint was percent reduction over PBO in baseline-adjusted partial-onset seizure frequency/week during the 12-week treatment period. Comparison of BRV with PBO was sequential (50, 20 mg/day, then 5 mg/day). Secondary endpoints included ≥50% responder rate and median percent reduction from baseline in partial-onset seizure frequency/week. Post hoc analyses included the primary efficacy endpoint evaluated over 28 days and exploratory subanalyses of efficacy by seizure subtype. Safety and tolerability assessments included treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), laboratory tests, electrocardiography, vital signs, and physical and neurologic examinations. Of 400 patients randomized, 396 were included in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population (PBO n = 98, BRV 5 mg/day n = 97, BRV 20 mg/day n = 100, BRV 50 mg/day n = 101) and 392 comprised the modified ITT (mITT) population. A total of 361 (91.2%) of 396 patients completed the study. Most patients (78.3%) were receiving two concomitant AEDs. Percent reduction in partial-onset seizure frequency/week over PBO was -0.9% (p = 0.885) for BRV 5 mg/day, 4.1% (p = 0.492) for BRV 20 mg/day, and 12.8% (p = 0.025) for BRV 50 mg/day (mITT population). Statistical significance was also achieved for the percent reduction over PBO in baseline-adjusted partial-onset seizure frequency/28 days for BRV 50 mg/day (22.0%; p = 0.004) but not for the other BRV dose groups. In the BRV 50 mg/day group, statistical significance was also seen for the ≥50% responder rate (BRV 32.7% vs. PBO 16.7%; p = 0.008) and median percent reduction from baseline in partial-onset seizure frequency/week (BRV 30.5% vs. PBO 17.8%; p = 0.003). In the exploratory subanalysis by seizure subtype, median percent reduction from baseline in seizure frequency/week and ≥50% responder rate were numerically greater than PBO in the BRV 20 and 50 mg/day groups for simple partial, complex partial, and secondarily generalized seizures. BRV was generally well tolerated, with the majority of TEAEs being mild-to-moderate in intensity. Of the TEAEs reported by ≥5% patients, those with a frequency >3% higher than PBO for any dose of BRV compared with PBO were somnolence, dizziness, fatigue, influenza, insomnia, nasopharyngitis, vomiting, diarrhea, urinary tract infection, and nausea.

{"id": 2229, "text": "Parents of children with epilepsy and other neurological conditions live with a feeling of constant uncertainty. The uncertainty associated with caring for a child with a neurological condition produces stress, which leads to decreased parental belief in caregiving skills, anxiety, and depression, ultimately altering parental functioning resulting in an increase in child behavioral problems. The stress associated with caring for children with neurological conditions is unlike caring for children with other chronic conditions. Neurological conditions are unpredictable, and there are often no warning signs before an acute event. This unpredictability accompanied with stigma results in social isolation and impacts family functioning. In addition, children with neurological conditions have a higher rate of psychological comorbidities and behavior problems when compared with children with other chronic conditions. This produces an additional burden on the parents and family. This randomized controlled trial tested the efficacy of the Creating Opportunities for Parent Empowerment intervention for parents of children with epilepsy and other neurological conditions. This intervention was administered at three intervals: (a) during hospital admission, (b) 3 days after hospital discharge by telephone, and (c) 4-6 weeks after hospital discharge. Forty-six parents of children admitted to the inpatient neuroscience unit at Boston Children's Hospital participated in the study. Several study limitations resulted in an inadequate sample size to obtain the power necessary to reach statistically significant results for most of the research questions. A one-between, one-within multivariate analysis of variance revealed that the main effect of time was significant for differences in state anxiety for both the usual care group and the intervention group, F(1, 20) = 9.86, p = .005, indicating that state anxiety for both groups combined was more pronounced during the hospitalization. A one-between, one-within multivariate analysis of variance showed that the effect of the interaction between time and group was significant for internalized behavior assessment system score only (p = .037) because the usual care group reported a significant decrease in internalizing behavior scores in their children over time. Findings from this study have significant implications for clinical practice and future research. Parents of children with neurological conditions often struggle to manage a constant feeling of uncertainty in their daily lives. Nurses possess the knowledge and expertise necessary to identify the psychosocial needs of these parents and provide education and support as needed. Future research should focus on designing interventions to meet the needs of these families and develop strategies to help improve the quality of life for both the parent and child living with a neurological condition.", "labels": [[1357, 1366, "N"], [1367, 1460, "Patient"], [1108, 1175, "Patient"], [1041, 1103, "Intervention"], [0, 67, "Patient"], [1817, 1837, "Control"], [2211, 2231, "Control"], [1177, 1355, "Intervention"], [2424, 2472, "Patient"], [1661, 1994, "Outcome"], [1996, 2324, "Outcome_2nd"]]}

In conclusion, prenatal AED exposure may increase the risk of behavioral problems in preschool children even after adjustments for potential confounders and maternal epilepsy.", "labels": [[271, 274, "N"], [286, 289, "N"], [397, 401, "N"], [188, 307, "Patient"]]}
{"id": 2337, "text": "Pregnant women with epilepsy on antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) may experience a reduction in serum AED levels. This has the potential to worsen seizure control. To determine if, in pregnant women with epilepsy on AEDs, additional therapeutic drug monitoring reduces seizure deterioration compared with clinical features monitoring after a reduction in serum AED levels. A double-blind, randomised trial nested within a cohort study was conducted and a qualitative study of acceptability of the two strategies was undertaken. Stratified block randomisation with a 1 : 1 allocation method was carried out. Fifty obstetric and epilepsy clinics in secondary and tertiary care units in the UK. Pregnant women with epilepsy on one or more of the following AEDs: lamotrigine, carbamazepine, phenytoin or levetiracetam. Women with a ≥ 25% decrease in serum AED level from baseline were randomised to therapeutic drug monitoring or clinical features monitoring strategies. In the therapeutic drug monitoring group, clinicians had access to clinical findings and monthly serum AED levels to guide AED dosage adjustment for seizure control. In the clinical features monitoring group, AED dosage adjustment was based only on clinical features. Primary outcome - seizure deterioration, defined as time to first seizure and to all seizures after randomisation per woman until 6 weeks post partum. Secondary outcomes - pregnancy complications in mother and offspring, maternal quality of life, seizure rates in cohorts with stable serum AED level, AED dose exposure and adverse events related to AEDs. Analysis of time to first and to all seizures after randomisation was performed using a Cox proportional hazards model, and multivariate failure time analysis by the Andersen-Gill model. The effects were reported as hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Secondary outcomes were reported as mean differences (MDs) or odds ratios. A total of 130 women were randomised to the therapeutic drug monitoring group and 133 to the clinical features monitoring group; 294 women did not have a reduction in serum AED level. A total of 127 women in the therapeutic drug monitoring group and 130 women in the clinical features monitoring group (98% of complete data) were included in the primary analysis. There were no significant differences in the time to first seizure (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.2) or timing of all seizures after randomisation (HR 1.3, 95% CI 0.7 to 2.5) between both trial groups. In comparison with the group with stable serum AED levels, there were no significant increases in seizures in the clinical features monitoring (odds ratio 0.93, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.5) or therapeutic drug monitoring group (odds ratio 0.93, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.5) associated with a reduction in serum AED levels. Maternal and neonatal outcomes were similar in both groups, except for higher cord blood levels of lamotrigine (MD 0.55 mg/l, 95% CI 0.11 to 1 mg/l) or levetiracetam (MD 7.8 mg/l, 95% CI 0.86 to 14.8 mg/l) in the therapeutic drug monitoring group than in the clinical features monitoring group. There were no differences between the groups on daily AED exposure or quality of life. An increase in exposure to lamotrigine, levetiracetam and carbamazepine significantly increased the cord blood levels of the AEDs, but not maternal or fetal complications. Women with epilepsy perceived the need for weighing up their increased vulnerability to seizures during pregnancy against the side effects of AEDs. Fewer women than the original target were recruited. There is no evidence to suggest that regular monitoring of serum AED levels in pregnancy improves seizure control or affects maternal or fetal outcomes. Further evaluation of the risks of seizure deterioration for various threshold levels of reduction in AEDs and the long-term neurodevelopment of infants born to mothers in both randomised groups is needed. An individualised prediction model will help to identify those women who need close monitoring in pregnancy. Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN01253916.

{"id": 2207, "text": "Perampanel is a selective, noncompetitive AMPA receptor antagonist with demonstrated efficacy and tolerability in partial seizures in patients aged ≥ 12 years in Phase III studies. Post-hoc analysis of these studies was conducted to determine the efficacy and tolerability of perampanel based on the number of concomitant antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) at baseline, as well as to examine which baseline characteristics, if any, were predictors of efficacy. Efficacy parameters were based on the number of baseline AEDs, and logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate the association of demographic and baseline clinical factors with probability of ≥ 50% reduction in seizure frequency. Patients on 1 AED at baseline were significantly more likely to have reduced seizure frequency (P<0.02) and improved 50% responder rate (P<0.02) than patients on 3 AEDs at baseline. Secondarily generalized seizures at baseline, unknown etiology, and use of concomitant non-inducer AEDs were also established as positive predictors of efficacy (50% responder rate; P<0.01). Patients with more AEDs at baseline were associated with greater use of inducers (P<0.01), which may result in decreased exposure of perampanel in these patients and lower efficacy. Patients with 1 AED at baseline had a significantly shorter time since diagnosis compared with patients in the 3 (P<0.01) AEDs group, as well as a lower median seizure frequency at baseline compared to patients on 3 AEDs (P<0.05), suggesting that the reduced efficacy of perampanel with 3 AEDs may also be associated with the greater severity of seizures in the patient groups. The incidence of adverse events in perampanel-treated patients was similar regardless of the number of AEDs at baseline. Greater efficacy is predicted for patients receiving fewer concomitant AEDs when starting perampanel, as well as for those receiving concomitant treatment with AEDs that are not CYP3A4 enzyme-inducers, compared to patients treated with multiple concomitant AEDs. The results of this study provide additional information for clinicians considering adding perampanel to their patients' treatment regimen earlier rather than later, and offer evidence regarding the potential for increased efficacy with a decreased medication burden.", "labels": [[114, 158, "Patient"]]}

The standard design for this trial requires a 3-day inpatient stay and is single-blind. We evaluated two marketed and effective AEDs-one narrow-spectrum [carbamazepine (CBZ)], and one broad-spectrum [levetiracetam (LEV)]-using a novel double-blinded, cross-over outpatient version of the trial to detect acute drug effects of the two marketed AEDs on photosensitivity. We tested 6 patients with a known stable photosensitivity response, using single oral doses of CBZ 400 mg and LEV 1000 mg, compared to 2 test days with single placebo doses. Patients who received LEV had the lowest mean PPR (compared with placebo and CBZ). The mixed effect model showed a significant effect of LEV in all eye closure conditions (p < 0.001). There was no evidence of a significant change in PPR after CBZ or placebo treatment. In conclusion, LEV 1000 mg, but not CBZ 400 mg, was effective in suppressing photosensitivity within a 6-h period compared with placebo showing the ability of our novel photosensitivity trial design to demonstrate effects of broad-spectrum AEDs.

A single dose of 99% pure CBD capsules was taken under both fasting (no breakfast) and fed (high fat 840-860 calorie) conditions. Blood sampling for CBD plasma concentrations was performed under each condition between 0 and 72 hours post-dose and measured by a validated liquid chormatography-mass spectometry assay. CBD pharmacokinetic profiles including maximum concentration (Cmax ), area-under-the-curve from zero to infinity (AUC0-∞ ), and time-to-maximum concentration (Tmax ) were calculated. The confidence intervals (CIs) for log-transformed Cmax and AUC0-∞ ratios between fed and fasting states were calculated. Seizure and adverse events information was collected. Eight patients completed the study. On average Cmax was 14 times and AUC0-∞ 4 times higher in the fed state. The 90% CI for the ratio of fed versus fast conditions for Cmax and AUC0-∞ were 7.47-31.86 and 3.42-7.82, respectively. No sequence or period effect for Cmax and AUC0-∞ was observed. No adverse events were reported. Administering CBD as a capsule rather than a liquid allows for more precise determination of pharmacokinetics parameters and is more representative of CBD swallowed products.

Lamotrigine and topiramate are also thought to possess broad spectrum activity. The SANAD study aimed to compare the longer-term effects of these drugs in patients with generalised onset seizures or seizures that are difficult to classify. SANAD was an unblinded randomised controlled trial in hospital-based outpatient clinics in the UK. Arm B of the study recruited 716 patients for whom valproate was considered to be standard treatment.

Potential recruitment sites were pre-visited, and district and local leaders met as key stakeholders. Key enablers were supportive local leadership and investment by the district and Ministry of Health. The main challenges were community fears about nodding syndrome, adverse experiences of the community during previous research and political involvement. Other challenges included the number and delays in protocol approvals and lengthy procurement processes.

If a seizure occurred during the evaluation period, patients were titrated to the next target level (level B: eslicarbazepine acetate 1200 mg/carbamazepine-CR 400 mg BID, level C: eslicarbazepine acetate 1600 mg/carbamazepine-CR 600 mg BID) and the evaluation period began again. The primary endpoint was the proportion of seizure-free patients for 6 months after stabilization in the per protocol set. The predefined noninferiority criteria were -12% absolute and -20% relative difference between treatment groups. Eight hundred fifteen patients were randomly assigned; 785 (388 in the eslicarbazepine acetate group and 397 in the carbamazepine-CR group) were included in the per protocol set, and 813 (401 in the eslicarbazepine acetate group and 412 in the carbamazepine-CR group) were included in the full analysis set for the primary analysis. Overall, 71.1% of eslicarbazepine acetate-treated patients and 75.6% of carbamazepine-CR-treated patients were seizure-free for ≥6 months at the last evaluated dose (average risk difference = -4.28%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -10.30 to 1.74; relative risk difference = -5.87%, 95% CI = -13.50 to 2.44) in the per protocol set. Rates of treatment-emergent adverse events were similar between groups for patients in the safety set. Noninferiority was also demonstrated in the full analysis set, as 70.8% of patients with eslicarbazepine acetate and 74.0% with carbamazepine-CR were seizure-free at the last evaluated dose (average risk difference = -3.07, 95% CI = -9.04 to 2.89). Treatment with eslicarbazepine acetate was noninferior to BID carbamazepine-CR.

{"id": 2464, "text": "Postictal generalized electroencephalographic suppression (PGES) is a pattern of low-voltage scalp electroencephalographic (EEG) activity following termination of generalized seizures. PGES has been associated with both sudden unexplained death in patients with epilepsy and therapeutic efficacy of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Automated detection of PGES epochs may aid in reliable quantification of this phenomenon. We developed a voltage-based algorithm for detecting PGES. This algorithm applies existing criteria to simulate expert epileptologist readings. Validation relied on postictal EEG recording from patients undergoing ECT (NCT02761330), assessing concordance among the algorithm and four clinical epileptologists. We observed low-to-moderate concordance among epileptologist ratings of PGES. Despite this, the algorithm displayed high discriminability in comparison to individual epileptologists (C-statistic range: 0.86-0.92). The algorithm displayed high discrimination (C-statistic: 0.91) and substantial peak agreement (Cohen's Kappa: 0.65) in comparison to a consensus of clinical ratings. Interrater agreement between the algorithm and individual epileptologists was on par with that among expert epileptologists. An automated voltage-based algorithm can be used to detect PGES following ECT, with discriminability nearing that of experts. Algorithmic detection may support clinical readings of PGES and improve precision when correlating this marker with clinical outcomes following generalized seizures.", "labels": []}

Both efficacy outcomes (median percent change from Baseline to Maintenance Phase in seizure frequency per 28 days and the proportion of patients experiencing at least a 50% reduction in seizures) were evaluated by lacosamide dose (200, 400, or 600 mg/day) compared to placebo for each seizure subtype. An additional analysis was performed to determine whether a shift from more severe focal seizure subtypes to less severe occurred upon treatment with lacosamide. In patients with CPS or SGPS at Baseline, lacosamide 400 mg/day (maximum recommended daily dose) and 600 mg/day reduced the frequency of CPS and SGPS compared to placebo. Likewise, a proportion of patients with CPS and SGPS at Baseline experienced at least a 50% reduction in the frequency of CPS and SGPS (≥50% responder rate) in the lacosamide 400 and 600 mg/day groups compared with placebo. For both outcomes, numerically greatest responses were observed in the lacosamide 600 mg/day group among patients with SGPS at Baseline. In patients with SPS at Baseline, no difference between placebo and lacosamide was observed for either efficacy outcome. An additional exploratory analysis suggests that in patients with SPS at Baseline, CPS and SGPS may have been shifted to less severe SPS upon treatment with lacosamide.

The physician chose VPA or CBZ as preferred standard treatment; patients were randomized to standard AEDs or LEV. The primary endpoint was time to treatment withdrawal. Results are exploratory, since KOMET was not powered for a subgroup analysis by age. Patients (n = 308) were randomized to LEV (n = 48) or VPA-ER (n = 53) in the VPE-ER stratum or to LEV (n = 104) or CBZ-CR (n = 103) in the CBZ-CR stratum. Mean age was 69.6 years, range 60.2-89.9 years (intention-to-treat population n = 307). Time to treatment withdrawal hazard ratio [HR] (95 % confidence interval [CI]) for LEV vs. standard AEDs was 0.44 (0.28-0.67); LEV vs. 0.46 (0.16-1.33); LEV vs. 0.45 (0.28-0.72). Twelve-month withdrawal rates were: LEV vs. standard AEDs, 20.4 vs. 38.7 %; LEV vs. VPA-ER, 10.4 vs. 23.1 %; LEV vs. CBZ-CR, 25.0 vs. 46.6 %.

A total of 50 volunteer patients with drug-resistant epilepsy were selected for a random clinical trial to observe the therapeutic effect of ta-VNS. The seizure frequency, quality of life, and severity were assessed in weeks 8, 16, and 24 of the treatment according to the percentage of seizure frequency reduction. In the pilot study, 47 of the 50 epilepsy patients completed the 24-week treatment; three dropped off. After 8-week treatment, six of the 47 patients (12%) were seizure free and 12 (24%) had a reduction in seizure frequency. In week 16 of the continuous treatment, six of the 47 patients (12%) were seizure free; 17 (34%) had a reduction in seizure frequency. After 24 weeks' treatment, eight patients (16%) were seizure free; 19 (38%) had reduced seizure frequency.

{"id": 2437, "text": "In recent randomized, placebo-controlled, phase III trials, highly purified cannabidiol demonstrated efficacy with an acceptable safety profile in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome or Dravet syndrome. It is anticipated that antiepileptic drugs such as stiripentol and valproate will be administered concomitantly with cannabidiol. This trial evaluated the effect of cannabidiol on steady-state pharmacokinetics of stiripentol or valproate in patients with epilepsy, and the safety and tolerability of cannabidiol. This phase II, two-arm, parallel-group, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial recruited male and female patients with epilepsy aged 16-55 years. Patients receiving a stable dose of stiripentol or valproate were randomized 4:1 to receive concomitant double-blind cannabidiol or placebo. Patients received plant-derived, highly purified cannabidiol medicine (Epidiolex ®  in the USA; Epidyolex ®  in the EU; 100 mg/mL oral solution) at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day from day 12 to 26, following a 10-day dose-escalation period. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic evaluations were collected on days 1 and 26 before stiripentol/valproate dosing and up to 12 h postdose. Treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) were recorded. In total, 35 patients were recruited to the stiripentol arm (n = 14) or the valproate arm (n = 21). Both the safety and the pharmacokinetic populations of the stiripentol arm comprised 14 patients (2 placebo; 12 cannabidiol). The safety population of the valproate arm comprised 20 patients (4 placebo; 16 cannabidiol; one withdrew before receiving treatment); the pharmacokinetic population comprised 15 patients (3 placebo; 12 cannabidiol). Concomitant cannabidiol led to a small increase in stiripentol exposure (17% increase in maximum observed plasma concentration [Cmax]; 30% increase in area under the concentration-time curve over the dosing interval [AUCtau]). Concomitant cannabidiol also had little effect on valproate exposure (13% decrease in Cmax; 17% decrease in AUCtau) or its metabolite, 2-propyl-4-pentenoic acid (4-ene-VPA) (23% decrease in Cmax; 30% decrease in AUCtau). All changes in exposure are expressed as the dose-normalized geometric mean (CV%) day 26 to day 1 ratio. The most common AE was diarrhea; most AEs were mild. Two patients discontinued cannabidiol because of serious AEs (rash [n = 1] in the stiripentol arm; hypertransaminasemia [n = 1] in the valproate arm). A separate in vitro study investigated the bidirectional effect of cannabidiol, or its metabolite 7-carboxy-cannabidiol, on valproate plasma protein binding; no change in plasma protein binding was observed for either compound. The clinical relevance of the increase in stiripentol exposure is unknown; patients receiving cannabidiol and stiripentol concomitantly should be monitored for adverse reactions as individual patient responses may vary. Coadministration of cannabidiol did not affect the pharmacokinetics of valproate or its metabolite, 4-ene-VPA, in adult patients with epilepsy. Safety results were consistent with the known safety profile of cannabidiol at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day.

The ANT is the structure of a limbic system with abundant neuronal connections to temporal and frontal brain regions that participate in seizure propagation circuitry.  We have performed a literature search regarding the clinical efficacy of ANT DBS. We discuss the surgical technique of the implantation of DBS electrodes with special attention paid to the targeting methods of the ANT. Moreover, we present in detail the clinical efficacy of ANT DBS, with a special emphasis on the stimulation parameters, a stimulation mode, and polarity. We also report all adverse events and present the current limitations of ANT DBS.  In general, the safety profile of DBS in intractable epilepsy patients is good, with a low rate of surgery, hardware-related, and stimulation-induced adverse events. No significant cognitive declines or worsening of depressive symptoms was noted. At long-term follow-up, the quality-of-life scores have improved. The limitations of ANT DBS studies include a limited number of patients treated and mostly open-label designs with only one double-blind, randomized multicenter trial. Most studies do not report the etiology of intractable epilepsy or they include nonhomogeneous groups of patients affected by intractable epilepsy. There are no guidelines for setting initial stimulation parameters. All the variables mentioned may have a profound impact on the final outcome.  ANT DBS appears to be a safe and efficacious treatment, particularly in patients with refractory partial seizures (three-quarters of patients gained at least 50% seizure reduction after 5 years). ANT DBS reduces most effectively the seizures originating in the temporal and frontal lobes. The published results of ANT DBS highlight promise and hope for patients with intractable epilepsy.", "labels": []}

Efficacy assessments included median percentage reductions in seizure frequency per 28 days and seizure-freedom rates for patients receiving placebo and perampanel 4 mg/d (modal dose). Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were assessed in patients receiving perampanel 4 mg/d at their TEAE onset. Outcomes were also assessed with/without enzyme-inducing antiseizure medications (EIASMs). The full analysis set included 979 patients with focal seizures (placebo: n = 616 [235 with FBTC seizures]; perampanel 4 mg/d: n = 363 [134 with FBTC seizures]). Compared with placebo, perampanel 4 mg/d conferred significantly greater median percentage reductions in seizure frequency per 28 days for focal (12.6% vs 21.1%; P = .0004) and FBTC seizures (17.4% vs 49.8%; P < .0001), and seizure-freedom rates for focal (0.8% vs 3.6%; P = .0018) and FBTC seizures (11.1% vs 18.7%; P = .0424). Seizure improvements with perampanel 4 mg/d were greater without EIASMs than with EIASMs. For assessment of TEAEs, overall 1376 patients with focal seizures received perampanel 4 mg/d at any time (FBTC seizures, n = 499). TEAEs with perampanel 4 mg/d occurred in 419 of 1376 (30.5%) and 148 of 499 (29.7%) patients with focal and FBTC seizures, respectively; most common was dizziness. The proportion of TEAEs was similar with or without EIASMs. This post hoc analysis showed adjunctive perampanel 4 mg/d was efficacious and well tolerated in patients with focal seizures, with or without FBTC seizures.

The Equivalence Among Antiepileptic Drug Generic and Brand Products in People With Epilepsy (EQUIGEN) single-dose study is a crossover, prospective, sequence-randomized, replicate pharmacokinetic study conducted at 5 US academic epilepsy centers. Fifty adults (≥18 years) with epilepsy who were taking concomitant antiepileptic drugs and not currently receiving lamotrigine were enrolled between July 18, 2013, and January 19, 2015. Every participant was randomly assigned to 1 of 3 equivalent sequences, each comprising 6 study periods, during which they had blood draws before and after medication administration. Forty-nine participants were included in intention-to-treat analyses. Participants received a single 25-mg dose of immediate-release lamotrigine at the start of each period, with the branded and the 2 most disparate generic products each studied twice. Lamotrigine was selected as the antiepileptic drug of interest because of its wide use, publications indicating problems with generic switches, and complaints to the US Food and Drug Administration regarding generic products. Both participants and study personnel were blinded to the specific generic products selected. The primary outcome was bioequivalence between products.

This study provides evidence that the disparate lamotrigine products studied are bioequivalent when tested in people with epilepsy taking concomitant antiepileptic drugs. clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01733394.", "labels": [[504, 506, "Patient"], [534, 539, "N"], [540, 660, "Patient"], [202, 209, "Intervention"], [216, 229, "Control"], [242, 285, "Intervention"], [995, 1047, "Intervention"], [1082, 1093, "Intervention"], [1098, 1135, "Control"], [1156, 1167, "Intervention"], [2110, 2299, "Outcome"], [2301, 2727, "Outcome_2nd"], [2839, 2898, "Patient"], [2763, 2797, "Intervention"]]}
{"id": 2477, "text": "There is evidence that everolimus (EVE) significantly reduces seizure frequency in epilepsy patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Given that TSC-related proliferative processes are more dynamic during brain development, seizure outcomes of patients treated with EVE may be age-related and may be less convincing in adult patients. The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness and the safety profile of EVE in adults in clinical practice. We performed a multicenter retrospective chart review of TSC subjects with active epilepsy who started EVE in adulthood (≥18 years of age) at seven German epilepsy centers. The primary endpoint was the retention rate after 6 months. A total of 45 subjects with a mean age of 31.6 ± 11.1 years at EVE start fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Retention rate after 6 months was 98% (43/44 evaluable subjects). Response rate (seizure reduction ≥ 50%) was 33% (14/43 evaluable subjects; four completely seizure-free). We did not find a significant relationship between epilepsy outcome parameters and patient age at EVE start. Adverse events were reported in 19 subjects and were judged to be serious in six patients. Three patients died during the observation period. Evidence suggests that EVE is an effective add-on treatment for epilepsy in adult TSC patients, surprisingly without any age limit to individual benefit. A strong age-dependent effect within the period of adulthood seems unlikely. Even if there was no proof of a causal relationship between deaths and EVE intake, patients with EVE should be carefully monitored, especially for infections and stomatitis.", "labels": [[701, 703, "N"], [83, 132, "Patient"], [514, 628, "Patient"], [23, 39, "Intervention"]]}
{"id": 2483, "text": "Epilepsy is a neurological disease that causes recurrent seizures and can have a significant impact on a person's quality of life (QOL). A self-management intervention (SMI) can allow adults with epilepsy to modify behaviors in order to manage their seizures and evaluate the impact of medication and treatments on their daily lives. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a SMI for adults with epilepsy. This was a longitudinal randomized controlled trial. Adults with epilepsy between the age of 20 and 65 years were recruited from a medical center in northern Taiwan. Participants were assigned to an intervention group (IG) or control group (CG) through simple randomization. Data regarding demographic and clinical characteristics were collected at baseline (T0). In addition, participants answered nine validated self-report questionnaires, which were used as outcome measures. Following collection of baseline data, the CG received routine monthly counseling over the next 3 months. The IG received the routine monthly counseling, as well as individual face-to-face health counseling on self-management 1 h/month and remote counseling via the phone or computer network at least twice per month. After the first month (T1) and at the end of the third (T2) and sixth months (T3) participants answered the nine questionnaires again. Differences in outcomes between the IGs and CGs were analyzed by comparing scores for the nine outcome variables at T0 with scores at T1, T2, and T3 with generalized estimating equations. A total of 210 adults agreed to participate in the study; however, only 155 participants completed the questionnaires for all three time points: 75 in the CG and 80 in the IG. The mean age of the 155 participants was 39.6 years (SD = 10.9). There was no significant difference between demographic or clinical variables between the two groups. The only difference in baseline scores (T0) among the nine self-report questionnaires was in epilepsy knowledge, measured with the Epilepsy Knowledge Profile questionnaire, which were significantly higher for the CG (mean = 32.28, SD = 3.92) than the IG (mean = 23.01, SD = 2.79) (p < 0.001). Generalized estimating equations (GEE) analysis showed scores decreased significantly at T3 from baseline for the CG for epilepsy knowledge and QOL (p < 0.001). Improvements in scores for sleep quality, anxiety, depression, self-efficacy, coping, and social support did not differ between groups. Classification of the IG by gender showed a significantly greater increase for males compared with females from baseline to T3 for epilepsy knowledge (p < 0.001). If we further classified the IGs by seizure frequency, participants with a seizure frequency of ≥1 per year had a more significant increase in epilepsy knowledge and increase in QOL compared with participants with a seizure frequency of <1 per year at T3 compared with T0. The lack of improvement in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) following the SMI may indicate that additional time is required to change behaviors that impact this variable for patients with epilepsy. Additional research should focus on variables associated with medication compliance, epilepsy knowledge, medicine symptom distress, self-efficacy, anxiety, and HRQoL.", "labels": [[1557, 1560, "N"], [137, 173, "Intervention"], [184, 204, "Patient"], [394, 399, "Intervention"], [404, 424, "Patient"], [479, 590, "Patient"], [1402, 1405, "Control"], [652, 670, "Control"], [944, 1009, "Control"], [622, 648, "Intervention"], [1011, 1221, "Intervention"], [1697, 1703, "Control"], [2098, 2104, "Control"], [2182, 2341, "Outcome"], [2642, 2913, "Outcome_2nd"], [2991, 2998, "Intervention"], [3095, 3117, "Patient"], [2292, 2298, "Control"], [2479, 2640, "Outcome_2nd"], [2343, 2477, "Outcome_2nd"]]}
