Patients with CVEE were identified based on epilepsy etiology recorded at baseline. In the initial monotherapy trial, 61 patients had CVEE (lacosamide: 27; carbamazepine-CR: 34). 20 (74.1%) patients on lacosamide (27 [79.4%] on carbamazepine-CR) reported treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), most commonly (≥10%) headache, dizziness, and fatigue (carbamazepine-CR: headache, dizziness). A numerically higher proportion of patients on lacosamide than carbamazepine-CR completed 6 months (22 [81.5%]; 20 [58.8%]) and 12 months (18 [66.7%]; 17 [50.0%]) treatment without seizure at last evaluated dose. In the conversion to monotherapy trial, 26/30 (86.7%) patients with CVEE reported TEAEs, most commonly (≥4 patients) dizziness, convulsion, fatigue, headache, somnolence, and cognitive disorder. During lacosamide monotherapy, 17 (56.7%) patients were 50% responders and six (20.0%) were seizure-free. In the observational study, 36/83 (43.4%) patients with CVEE reported TEAEs, most commonly (≥5%) fatigue and dizziness. Effectiveness was assessed for 75 patients. During the last 3 months, 60 (80%) were 50% responders and 42 (56.0%) were seizure-free.

Our results were also consistent with presurgical evaluation of the remaining one patient without surgery and may explain why she was not suitable for resection treatment. In the motor task study of ten healthy subjects, our method revealed components with concordant spatial and temporal features as expected from the unilateral motor tasks. In the resting state study of seven healthy subjects, the method successfully rejected all components in four out of seven subjects as non-epilepsy related components.

{"id": 2024, "text": "The purpose of this work was to determine in a clinical trial the efficacy of reducing or preventing seizures in patients with neurological handicaps through sustained cortical activation evoked by passive exposure to a specific auditory stimulus (particular music). The specific type of stimulation had been determined in previous studies to evoke anti-epileptiform/anti-seizure brain activity. The study was conducted at the Thad E. Saleeby Center in Harstville, South Carolina, which is a permanent residence for individuals with heterogeneous neurological impairments, many with epilepsy. We investigated the ability to reduce or prevent seizures in subjects through cortical stimulation from sustained passive nightly exposure to a specific auditory stimulus (music) in a three-year randomized controlled study. In year 1, baseline seizure rates were established. In year 2, subjects were randomly assigned to treatment and control groups. Treatment group subjects were exposed during sleeping hours to specific music at regular intervals. Control subjects received no music exposure and were maintained on regular anti-seizure medication. In year 3, music treatment was terminated and seizure rates followed. We found a significant treatment effect (p = 0.024) during the treatment phase persisting through the follow-up phase (p = 0.002). Subjects exposed to treatment exhibited a significant 24% decrease in seizures during the treatment phase, and a 33% decrease persisting through the follow-up phase. Twenty-four percent of treatment subjects exhibited a complete absence of seizures during treatment. Exposure to specific auditory stimuli (i.e. music) can significantly reduce seizures in subjects with a range of epilepsy and seizure types, in some cases achieving a complete cessation of seizures. These results are consistent with previous work showing reductions in epileptiform activity from particular music exposure and offers potential for achieving a non-invasive, non-pharmacologic treatment of epilepsy.

The purpose of this phase III study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety/tolerability of adjunctive BRV in adults with uncontrolled partial-onset (focal) seizures. This was a prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, fixed-dose trial (N01253; NCT00464269). Adults aged 16-70 years with well-characterized partial epilepsy not fully controlled despite treatment with one or two antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) were enrolled. Patients who experienced eight or more partial-onset seizures, whether or not secondarily generalized, during the 8-week prospective baseline period were randomized (1:1:1:1) to receive twice-daily placebo (PBO) or BRV (5, 20, or 50 mg/day) without titration. The primary efficacy endpoint was percent reduction over PBO in baseline-adjusted partial-onset seizure frequency/week during the 12-week treatment period. Comparison of BRV with PBO was sequential (50, 20 mg/day, then 5 mg/day). Secondary endpoints included ≥50% responder rate and median percent reduction from baseline in partial-onset seizure frequency/week. Post hoc analyses included the primary efficacy endpoint evaluated over 28 days and exploratory subanalyses of efficacy by seizure subtype. Safety and tolerability assessments included treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), laboratory tests, electrocardiography, vital signs, and physical and neurologic examinations. Of 400 patients randomized, 396 were included in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population (PBO n = 98, BRV 5 mg/day n = 97, BRV 20 mg/day n = 100, BRV 50 mg/day n = 101) and 392 comprised the modified ITT (mITT) population. A total of 361 (91.2%) of 396 patients completed the study. Most patients (78.3%) were receiving two concomitant AEDs. Percent reduction in partial-onset seizure frequency/week over PBO was -0.9% (p = 0.885) for BRV 5 mg/day, 4.1% (p = 0.492) for BRV 20 mg/day, and 12.8% (p = 0.025) for BRV 50 mg/day (mITT population). Statistical significance was also achieved for the percent reduction over PBO in baseline-adjusted partial-onset seizure frequency/28 days for BRV 50 mg/day (22.0%; p = 0.004) but not for the other BRV dose groups. In the BRV 50 mg/day group, statistical significance was also seen for the ≥50% responder rate (BRV 32.7% vs. PBO 16.7%; p = 0.008) and median percent reduction from baseline in partial-onset seizure frequency/week (BRV 30.5% vs. PBO 17.8%; p = 0.003). In the exploratory subanalysis by seizure subtype, median percent reduction from baseline in seizure frequency/week and ≥50% responder rate were numerically greater than PBO in the BRV 20 and 50 mg/day groups for simple partial, complex partial, and secondarily generalized seizures. BRV was generally well tolerated, with the majority of TEAEs being mild-to-moderate in intensity. Of the TEAEs reported by ≥5% patients, those with a frequency >3% higher than PBO for any dose of BRV compared with PBO were somnolence, dizziness, fatigue, influenza, insomnia, nasopharyngitis, vomiting, diarrhea, urinary tract infection, and nausea.

The aim of this study was to assess, in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of seizure-free patients with epilepsy, the effect of withdrawal of AEDs in patients on monotherapy on measures of mood and behavior. One hundred fifteen subjects who had been seizure-free >2 years on drug monotherapy went through a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.

Comparable results were achieved in the subgroup taking carbamazepine. For patients with a high degree of depressive and somatic symptoms at baseline, no significant differences in symptoms emerged in the withdrawal group compared with the non-withdrawal group.

Four patients were enrolled in each of the first three cohorts. Six patients were enrolled in the fourth cohort and one patient was enrolled in the fifth cohort. PPR responses to 14 IPS frequencies (steps) were used to determine the standard photosensitivity range (SPR) following placebo on day 1 and ICA-105665 on day 2. The SPR was quantified for three eye conditions (eyes closing, eyes closed, and eyes open), and the most sensitive condition was used for assessment of efficacy. A partial response was defined as a reduction in the SPR of at least three units at three separate time points following ICA-105665 compared to the same time points following placebo with no time points with more than three units of increase. Complete suppression was defined by no PPRs in any eye condition at one or more time points. Six individual patients participated in the first three cohorts (100, 200, and 400 mg). Six patients participated in the fourth cohort (500 mg), and one patient participated in the fifth cohort (600 mg).

{"id": 2144, "text": "In patients with epilepsy, poor adherence to anti-epileptic drugs has been shown to be the most important cause of poorly controlled epilepsy. Furthermore, it has been noted that the quality of life among patients with epilepsy can be improved by counseling and treatments aimed at increasing their self-efficacy and concordance, thus stimulating self-management skills. However, there is a need for evidence on the effectiveness of such programs, especially within epilepsy care. Therefore, we have developed a multi-component intervention (MCI) which combines a self-management/education program with e-Health interventions. Accordingly, the overall objective of this study is to assess the (cost)-effectiveness and feasibility of the MCI, aiming to improve self-efficacy and concordance in patients with epilepsy. A RCT in two parallel groups will be conducted to compare the MCI with a control condition in epilepsy patients. One hundred eligible epilepsy patients will be recruited and allocated to either the intervention or control group. The intervention group will receive the MCI consisting of a self-management/education program of six meetings, including e-Health interventions, and will be followed for 12 months. The control group will receive care as usual and will be followed for 6 months, after which patients will be offered the possibility of participating in the MCI. The study will consist of three parts: 1) a clinical effectiveness study, 2) a cost-effectiveness study, and 3) process evaluation. The primary outcome will be self-efficacy. Secondary outcomes include adherence, side effects, change in seizure severity & frequency, improved quality of life, proactive coping, and societal costs. Outcome assessments will be done using questionnaires at baseline and after 3, 6, 9, and 12 months (last two applicable only for intervention group).

{"id": 2162, "text": "Treatment of newly diagnosed epilepsy with a single antiepileptic drug (AED) is the favored approach for seizure management. This observational study aimed to assess, under daily practice conditions, remission and retention rates with the first AED prescribed as monotherapy in patients newly or recently diagnosed with focal epilepsy. The treatment registry in focal epilepsy (TRIP) study was conducted on 234 Lebanese patients with newly or recently diagnosed focal epilepsy, requiring treatment with an AED. Demographics, baseline focal seizure characteristics and results of the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale at the 12-month visit were reported. The primary objective of this study was to assess the percentage of patients who achieved a 6-month terminal seizure remission at the 12-month visit following treatment with a first AED administered as monotherapy. Secondary outcome variables included the calculation of the 6-month terminal seizure remission according to the baseline seizure types and patient retention at the 12 and 18 month visits. In addition, bivariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to identify independent predictors of 6-month terminal seizure remission at the 12-month visit. The mean age of the 234 eligible patients was 31.6 years and the majority were males (62%). At baseline, the most common type of focal seizures was focal seizures with impairment of consciousness (45%), and the most frequent topographical localization was in the temporal lobe (47%). In total, 77.6% of the patients achieved a 6-month terminal seizure remission at the 12-month visit. Patients with an epileptogenic lesion on neuroimaging were significantly less likely to achieve a 6-month remission compared to those with no identifiable pathological substrate. Patients with focal motor seizures without impairment of consciousness at baseline had significantly lower odds of achieving a 6-month terminal seizure remission compared to patients with a combination of seizure types. There was no significant association between age or gender and 6-month terminal seizure remission. The retention rates were 95.7% and 88.5% at months 12 and 18 respectively with the great majority of patients (90.7%) reporting marked improvement on the CGI scale. A substantial proportion of patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy achieved a 6-month terminal seizure remission following treatment with a first AED administered as monotherapy. Patients with an epileptogenic lesion on neuroimaging and those with focal motor seizures without impairment of consciousness at baseline were significantly less likely to achieve a 6-month terminal seizure remission. This study demonstrated the feasibility of conducting long-term multicenter studies in Lebanon and will hopefully serve as an impetus to conduct randomized studies in the field of epilepsy.", "labels": []}

{"id": 2522, "text": "Following a single seizure, or recent epilepsy diagnosis, it is difficult to balance risk of medication side effects with the potential to prevent seizure recurrence. A prediction model was developed and validated enabling risk stratification which in turn informs treatment decisions and individualises counselling. Data from a randomised controlled trial was used to develop a prediction model for risk of seizure recurrence following a first seizure or diagnosis of epilepsy. Time-to-event data was modelled via Cox's proportional hazards regression. Model validity was assessed via discrimination and calibration using the original dataset and also using three external datasets - National General Practice Survey of Epilepsy (NGPSE), Western Australian first seizure database (WA) and FIRST (Italian dataset of people with first tonic-clonic seizures). People with neurological deficit, focal seizures, abnormal EEG, not indicated for CT/MRI scan, or not immediately treated have a significantly higher risk of seizure recurrence. Discrimination was fair and consistent across the datasets (c-statistics: 0.555 (NGPSE); 0.558 (WA); 0.597 (FIRST)). Calibration plots showed good agreement between observed and predicted probabilities in NGPSE at one and three years. Plots for WA and FIRST showed poorer agreement with the model underpredicting risk in WA, and over-predicting in FIRST. This was resolved following model recalibration. The model performs well in independent data especially when recalibrated. It should now be used in clinical practice as it can improve the lives of people with single seizures and early epilepsy by enabling targeted treatment choices and more informed patient counselling.", "labels": []}
{"id": 2119, "text": "Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is an important indicator of well-being in patients with epilepsy. When assessing changes in HRQOL over time, some of the changes observed may be due to the patients' change in the internal standards, value, or meaning that they attribute to the HRQOL domain being measured, rather than actual change, a phenomenon known as response shift. Response shifts are increasingly recognized as an important explanation for the seemingly paradoxical or counterintuitive HRQOL results often observed in chronic conditions. We investigated the presence of changing values (reprioritization response shift) in data from a surgical randomized controlled trial of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Eighty patients with TLE, who were randomized to surgical and medical treatment, provided data on the epilepsy-specific 31-item Quality of life in Epilepsy (QOLIE-31) questionnaire at baseline and 1 year after randomization. Reprioritization response shift among the seven QOLIE-31 domains was assessed using changes in the relative importance weights derived from logistic regression and discriminant analysis. The relative importance analysis showed a statistically significant increase over time in the importance of social function, but a significant decrease in the relative importance of seizure worry. There were no significant changes in the relative importance of the remaining five domains in distinguishing between surgical and medical group over time. Patients that receive surgical treatment are more likely to experience a decrease in the valuation of seizure worry and an increase in the value of social function as compared to patients who are medically treated. Changes in expectation about seizure freedom and social function may confound the assessment of longitudinal change on these outcomes, and highlight the importance of assessing response shift and the limitations of assessing HRQOL at a single point in time or without a control group.

To develop the intervention, an existing group-based seizure management course that has been offered by the Epilepsy Society within the voluntary sector to a broader audience will be adapted. Feedback from PWE, carers and representatives from the main groups caring for PWE will help refine the course so that it addresses the needs of ED attendees. Its behaviour change potential will also be optimised. A pilot randomised controlled trial will then be completed. 80 PWE aged ≥16 who have visited the ED in the prior 12 months on ≥2 occasions, along with one of their family members or friends, will be recruited from three NHS EDs. Dyads will be randomised to receive the intervention or treatment as usual alone. The proposed primary outcome is ED use in the 12 months following randomisation. For the pilot, this will be measured using routine hospital data. Secondary outcomes will be measured by patients and carers completing questionnaires 3, 6 and 12 months postrandomisation.

{"id": 2253, "text": "Infantile spasms constitutes a severe infantile epilepsy syndrome that is difficult to treat and has a high morbidity. Hormonal therapies or vigabatrin are the most commonly used treatments. We aimed to assess whether combining the treatments would be more effective than hormonal therapy alone. In this multicentre, open-label randomised trial, 102 hospitals (Australia [three], Germany [11], New Zealand [two], Switzerland [three], and the UK [83]) enrolled infants who had a clinical diagnosis of infantile spasms and a hypsarrhythmic (or similar) EEG no more than 7 days before enrolment. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) by a secure website to receive hormonal therapy with vigabatrin or hormonal therapy alone. If parents consented, there was an additional randomisation (1:1) of type of hormonal therapy used (prednisolone or tetracosactide depot). Block randomisation was stratified for hormonal treatment and risk of developmental impairment. Parents and clinicians were not masked to therapy, but investigators assessing electro-clinical outcome were masked to treatment allocation. Minimum doses were prednisolone 10 mg four times a day or intramuscular tetracosactide depot 0·5 mg (40 IU) on alternate days with or without vigabatrin 100 mg/kg per day. The primary outcome was cessation of spasms, which was defined as no witnessed spasms on and between day 14 and day 42 from trial entry, as recorded by parents and carers in a seizure diary. Analysis was by intention to treat. The trial is registered with The International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN), number 54363174, and the European Union Drug Regulating Authorities Clinical Trials (EUDRACT), number 2006-000788-27. Between March 7, 2007, and May 22, 2014, 766 infants were screened and, of those, 377 were randomly assigned to hormonal therapy with vigabatrin (186) or hormonal therapy alone (191). All 377 infants were assessed for the primary outcome. Between days 14 and 42 inclusive no spasms were witnessed in 133 (72%) of 186 patients on hormonal therapy with vigabatrin compared with 108 (57%) of 191 patients on hormonal therapy alone (difference 15·0%, 95% CI 5·1-24·9, p=0·002). Serious adverse reactions necessitating hospitalisation occurred in 33 infants (16 on hormonal therapy alone and 17 on hormonal therapy with vigabatrin). The most common serious adverse reaction was infection occurring in five infants on hormonal therapy alone and four on hormonal therapy with vigabatrin. There were no deaths attributable to treatment. Hormonal therapy with vigabatrin is significantly more effective at stopping infantile spasms than hormonal therapy alone. The 4 week period of spasm cessation required to achieve a primary clinical response to treatment suggests that the effect seen might be sustained, but this needs to be confirmed at the 18 month follow-up.

Seventy-nine WWE of childbearing age were recruited from Epilepsy Action Australia between October and November 2013 and randomized to receive the intervention (the DA) or not, and to complete a set of questionnaires pre- and post- intervention. The DA, delivered as a PDF booklet, provided balanced evidence-based information about options, risks and benefits, including probabilities; as well as steps for clarifying values and considering options within one's personal situation. Compared with the control group, the DA group had statistically significant improvements in knowledge about pregnancy and epilepsy (Cohen's d = 1.24; 95%CI = 0.77 to 1.83) and reduced decisional conflict (Cohen's d = 0.59; 95%CI = 0.21 to 0.99). Changes in decision self-efficacy, certainty of choice, patient-practitioner communication abilities and value congruence with choice were comparable between the DA and control group. Importantly, women's decisions about motherhood were not biased towards either direction, and there were no adverse effects on depression or anxiety. All women who received the DA indicated they would recommend it to other WWE. The DA has the potential to serve as a useful support tool for WWE who are considering motherhood.

In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted at 30 clinical centers, we randomly assigned patients with the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (age range, 2 to 55 years) who had had two or more drop seizures per week during a 28-day baseline period to receive cannabidiol oral solution at a dose of either 20 mg per kilogram of body weight (20-mg cannabidiol group) or 10 mg per kilogram (10-mg cannabidiol group) or matching placebo, administered in two equally divided doses daily for 14 weeks. The primary outcome was the percentage change from baseline in the frequency of drop seizures (average per 28 days) during the treatment period. A total of 225 patients were enrolled; 76 patients were assigned to the 20-mg cannabidiol group, 73 to the 10-mg cannabidiol group, and 76 to the placebo group. During the 28-day baseline period, the median number of drop seizures was 85 in all trial groups combined. The median percent reduction from baseline in drop-seizure frequency during the treatment period was 41.9% in the 20-mg cannabidiol group, 37.2% in the 10-mg cannabidiol group, and 17.2% in the placebo group (P=0.005 for the 20-mg cannabidiol group vs. placebo group, and P=0.002 for the 10-mg cannabidiol group vs. placebo group). The most common adverse events among the patients in the cannabidiol groups were somnolence, decreased appetite, and diarrhea; these events occurred more frequently in the higher-dose group. Six patients in the 20-mg cannabidiol group and 1 patient in the 10-mg cannabidiol group discontinued the trial medication because of adverse events and were withdrawn from the trial.

The safety and tolerability of PER have been well-documented in three double-blind, randomized, placebo (PBO)-controlled Phase III studies and an open-label extension (OLE). This post hoc analysis evaluated the occurrence and characteristics of the most common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) associated with PER. Results from the Phase III studies were pooled; post hoc analyses on the double-blind phase and up to 1 year of the OLE were performed on the four most common TEAEs for which incidence was higher for PER than PBO. The four most common TEAEs were dizziness, somnolence, fatigue, and irritability. For most subjects in the Phase III double-blind studies, these TEAEs were observed during 6-week titration and were mild or moderate in severity. For severe AEs, no dose-response relationship was observed. Patients in the PBO group during Phase III (who therefore received their first PER treatment during OLE) experienced these TEAEs with incidence and timing similar to that of PER-treated patients in Phase III. The first onset of these TEAEs occurred during the early weeks of PER conversion in the OLE. After 6months and up to 1 year of PER treatment, low to no incidence of the first onset of the four TEAEs was observed. Post hoc analyses of data from pooled Phase III studies provide greater insight into occurrence/duration of TEAEs. Phase III double-blind and OLE data showed that dizziness, somnolence, fatigue, and irritability were the most common TEAEs reported by patients taking PER. Additionally, these results suggest consistency between studies in patient responses to onset of these TEAEs. Although concomitant antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) might be predicted to affect development of TEAEs in patients taking PER, an effect was not observed in this analysis.

Estimates of its effects, including on ED use, will be produced by the trial. Whilst hardly ever reported for trials of epilepsy interventions-only one publication on this topic exists-this study provides the information on treatment fidelity necessary to allow the trial's estimates to be accurately interpreted. This rare worked example of how fidelity can be assessed could also provide guidance sought by neurology trialists on how to assess fidelity. 53 patients who had visited ED on ≥2 occasions in prior year were recruited for the trial; 26 were randomized to the intervention. 7 intervention courses were delivered for them by one facilitator. Using audio recordings, treatment adherence and competence were assessed. Adherence was assessed by a checklist of the items comprising the intervention. Using computer software, competence was measured by calculating facilitator speech during the intervention (didacticism). Interrater reliability was evaluated by two independent raters assessing each course using the measures and their ratings being compared. The fidelity measures were found to be reliable. For the adherence instrument, raters agreed 96% of the time, PABAK-OS kappa 0.91. For didacticism, raters' scores had an intraclass coefficient of 0.96. In terms of treatment fidelity, not only were courses found to have been delivered with excellent adherence (88% of its items were fully delivered) but also as intended they were highly interactive, with the facilitator speaking for, on average, 55% of course time. The fidelity measures used were reliable and showed that the intervention was delivered as attended.

Multivariable regression modelling was used to investigate how clinical factors affect the probability of achieving 12-month remission and treatment failure. Significant factors in the multivariable model for time to 12-month remission were having a relative with epilepsy, neurological insult, total number of tonic-clonic seizures before randomisation, seizure type and treatment. Significant factors in the multivariable model for time to treatment failure were treatment history (antiepileptic drug treatment prior to randomisation), EEG result, seizure type and treatment.

Patients receiving a stable oral dosage of carbamazepine were switched to an intravenous (IV) carbamazepine formulation solubilized in a cyclodextrin matrix (at a 70% dosage conversion) for either a 15- or a 30-min infusion every 6 h for up to 7 days and then switched back. A subset of patients who tolerated 15-min infusions also received 2- to 5-min (rapid) infusions. Assessments included physical and laboratory evaluations, electrocardiography (ECG) studies, as well as adverse event (AE) monitoring for tolerability. Convulsion/seizure AE terms and data from seizure diaries were used as proxies for the assessment of consistency of seizure control between formulations. Of the 203 patients exposed to IV carbamazepine (30 min, n = 43; 15 min, n = 160), 113 received 149 rapid infusions. During infusion, the most commonly reported AEs (≥ 5%) were dizziness (19%), somnolence (6%), headache (6%), and blurred vision (5%). IV carbamazepine was not associated with clinically relevant cardiac AEs. The tolerability profile appeared similar between patients who received <1,600 mg/day (n = 174) and ≥ 1,600 mg/day (n = 29) carbamazepine. Cyclodextrin exposure was not associated with clinically relevant changes in AEs or renal biomarkers. Seizure control was maintained as patients transitioned between oral and IV carbamazepine. IV carbamazepine administered as multiple 30- or 15-min infusions every 6 h, and as a single rapid infusion, was well tolerated as a short-term replacement in adults with epilepsy receiving stable dosages of oral carbamazepine.

Three English hospital emergency departments (EDs). Patients aged ≥16 with established epilepsy reporting ≥2 ED visits in the prior 12 months and their significant others (SOs). Patients (and their SOs) were randomly allocated (1:1) to SAFE plus treatment-as-usual (TAU) or TAU alone. SAFE is a 4-hour group course. Two criteria evaluated a definitive RCT's feasibility: (1) ≥20% of eligible patients needed to be consented into the pilot trial; (2) routine data on use of ED over the 12 months postrandomisation needed securing for ≥75%. Other measures included eligibility, ease of obtaining routine data, availability of self-report ED data and comparability, SAFE's effect and intervention cost. Of ED attendees with a suspected seizure, 424 (10.6%) patients were eligible; 53 (12.5%) patients and 38 SOs consented. Fifty-one patients (and 37 SOs) were randomised. Routine data on ED use at 12 months were secured for 94.1% patients. Self-report ED data were available for 66.7% patients. Patients reported more visits compared with routine data. Most (76.9%) patients randomised to SAFE received it and no related serious adverse events occurred. ED use at 12 months was lower in the SAFE+TAU arm compared with TAU alone, but not significantly (rate ratio=0.62, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.17). A definitive trial would need ~674 patient participants and ~39 recruitment sites. Obtaining routine data was challenging, taking ~8.5 months. In satisfying only one predetermined 'stop/go' criterion, a definitive RCT is not feasible. The low consent rate in the pilot trial raises concerns about a definitive trial's finding's external validity and means it would be expensive to conduct.

{"id": 2385, "text": "Phenytoin is the current standard of care for second-line treatment of paediatric convulsive status epilepticus after failure of first-line benzodiazepines, but is only effective in 60% of cases and is associated with considerable adverse effects. A newer anticonvulsant, levetiracetam, can be given more quickly, is potentially more efficacious, and has a more tolerable adverse effect profile. We aimed to determine whether phenytoin or levetiracetam is the superior second-line treatment for paediatric convulsive status epilepticus. ConSEPT was an open-label, multicentre, randomised controlled trial conducted in 13 emergency departments in Australia and New Zealand. Children aged between 3 months and 16 years, with convulsive status epilepticus that failed first-line benzodiazepine treatment, were randomly assigned (1:1) using a computer-generated permuted block (block sizes 2 and 4) randomisation sequence, stratified by site and age (≤5 years, >5 years), to receive 20 mg/kg phenytoin (intravenous or intraosseous infusion over 20 min) or 40 mg/kg levetiracetam (intravenous or intraosseous infusion over 5 min). The primary outcome was clinical cessation of seizure activity 5 min after the completion of infusion of the study drug. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, number ACTRN12615000129583. Between March 19, 2015, and Nov 29, 2017, 639 children presented to participating emergency departments with convulsive status epilepticus; 127 were missed, and 278 did not meet eligibility criteria. The parents of one child declined to give consent, leaving 233 children (114 assigned to phenytoin and 119 assigned to levetiracetam) in the intention-to-treat population. Clinical cessation of seizure activity 5 min after completion of infusion of study drug occurred in 68 (60%) patients in the phenytoin group and 60 (50%) patients in the levetiracetam group (risk difference -9·2% [95% CI -21·9 to 3·5]; p=0·16). One participant in the phenytoin group died at 27 days because of haemorrhagic encephalitis; this death was not thought to be due to the study drug. There were no other serious adverse events.

{"id": 2331, "text": "Epilepsy is a common neurological condition resulting in recurrent seizures. Research evidence in long-term conditions suggests that patients benefit from self-management education and that this may improve quality of life (QoL). Epilepsy self-management education has yet to be tested in a UK setting. To determine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of Self-Management education for people with poorly controlled epILEpsy [SMILE (UK)]. A parallel pragmatic randomised controlled trial. Participants were recruited from eight hospitals in London and south-east England. Adults aged ≥ 16 years with epilepsy and two or more epileptic seizures in the past year, who were currently being prescribed antiepileptic drugs. A 2-day group self-management course alongside treatment as usual (TAU). The control group received TAU. The primary outcome is QoL in people with epilepsy at 12-month follow-up using the Quality Of Life In Epilepsy 31-P (QOLIE-31-P) scale. Other outcomes were seizure control, impact of epilepsy, medication adverse effects, psychological distress, perceived stigma, self-mastery and medication adherence. Cost-effectiveness analyses and a process evaluation were undertaken. A 1 : 1 ratio between trial arms using fixed block sizes of two. Participants were not blinded to their group allocation because of the nature of the study. Researchers involved in data collection and analysis remained blinded throughout. The trial completed successfully. A total of 404 participants were enrolled in the study [SMILE (UK), n = 205; TAU, n = 199] with 331 completing the final follow-up at 12 months [SMILE (UK), n = 163; TAU, n = 168]. In the intervention group, 61.5% completed all sessions of the course. No adverse events were found to be related to the intervention. At baseline, participants had a mean age of 41.7 years [standard deviation (SD) 14.1 years], and had epilepsy for a median of 18 years. The mean QOLIE-31-P score for the whole group at baseline was 66.0 out of 100.0 (SD 14.2). Clinically relevant levels of anxiety symptoms were reported in 53.6% of the group and depression symptoms in 28.0%. The results following an intention-to-treat analysis showed no change in any measures at the 12-month follow-up [QOLIE-31-P: SMILE (UK) mean: 67.4, SD 13.5; TAU mean: 69.5, SD 14.8]. The cost-effectiveness study showed that SMILE (UK) was possibly cost-effective but was also associated with lower QoL. The process evaluation with 20 participants revealed that a group course increased confidence by sharing with others and improved self-management behaviours. For people with epilepsy and persistent seizures, a 2-day self-management education course is cost-saving, but does not improve QoL after 12-months or reduce anxiety or depression symptoms. A psychological intervention may help with anxiety and depression. Interviewed participants reported attending a group course increased their confidence and helped them improve their self-management. More research is needed on self-management courses, with psychological components and integration with routine monitoring. Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN57937389.
