Previous studies have primarily reported minor influence on neuropsychological raw scores, and the clinical relevance of these findings is unclear. To obtain a clinical valid answer to this question, we analysed changes in T-scores after AED withdrawal in a large group of well-controlled epilepsy patients, for tests previously shown to be sensitive to AED withdrawal. We report outcomes on measures of choice reaction time from the California Computerized Assessment Package, on the Controlled Oral Word Association Test and on the Stroop Color-Word Interference Test. Significantly improved T-scores were revealed after AED withdrawal on five of the six tests of executive functions with mean improvement of 5 T-scores. Comparable results were achieved in the subgroup taking carbamazepine, with a mean improvement of 6.2 T-scores. The present results suggest that T-scores for computerized tests of choice reaction time and tests of verbal fluency and response inhibition may be significantly impaired as a consequence of AED monotherapy, and that careful interpretation of these scores is required in diagnostic assessment of patients receiving AED monotherapy.", "labels": []}

Seven participants with a photoparoxysmal response to intermittent photic stimulation (IPS) at baseline were randomized in a double-blind, 4-period cross-over study examining single doses of 17.5 and 52.5 mg PF-06372865, 2 mg lorazepam (active control), and placebo. Standardized photosensitivity ranges (SPRs) to IPS were recorded at screening, predose, and 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours postdose. The primary endpoint was the average least squares mean change in the SPR in the participant's most sensitive eye condition, across all time points. Both doses of PF-06372865 produced a marked and statistically significant mean reduction in SPR compared to placebo, which was similar in degree to lorazepam. There was complete suppression of SPR in 6/7 participants following PF-06372865 or lorazepam administration. PF-06372865 was safe and well-tolerated. PF-06372865 demonstrated highly robust efficacy.

Patients included in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of either one or three years of ASM therapy prior to withdrawal (if seizure-free for at least 6 months) were contacted after 29-35 years and asked to complete a survey. Potential prognostic factors were evaluated: duration of initial ASM treatment, seizure type, seizure frequency, and score in a prognostic model developed in the initial publication. One hundred and forty-nine subjects answered the questionnaire (response rate 65%). Seizure freedom without treatment was found in 110 responders (77%, 95%CI: 73-81). There was no significant difference in score in the prognostic model between responders with and without epilepsy at follow-up. Those with active epilepsy were unemployed significantly more often and perceived their mental health significantly more affected than those seizure-free without treatment. Duration of initial ASM treatment was not associated with any difference in subsequent epilepsy risk. This indicates that the timing of withdrawal attempts is unlikely to alter the long-term prognosis of uncomplicated childhood epilepsy. The failure of the prognostic model from the initial study to predict long-term outcome argues that although prediction of relapse risk in the shorter term may be possible, the bearing of such models on long-term epilepsy risk is more questionable.", "labels": [[54, 153, "Patient"], [733, 759, "N"]]}

Seventy-nine WWE of childbearing age were recruited from Epilepsy Action Australia between October and November 2013 and randomized to receive the intervention (the DA) or not, and to complete a set of questionnaires pre- and post- intervention. The DA, delivered as a PDF booklet, provided balanced evidence-based information about options, risks and benefits, including probabilities; as well as steps for clarifying values and considering options within one's personal situation. Compared with the control group, the DA group had statistically significant improvements in knowledge about pregnancy and epilepsy (Cohen's d = 1.24; 95%CI = 0.77 to 1.83) and reduced decisional conflict (Cohen's d = 0.59; 95%CI = 0.21 to 0.99). Changes in decision self-efficacy, certainty of choice, patient-practitioner communication abilities and value congruence with choice were comparable between the DA and control group. Importantly, women's decisions about motherhood were not biased towards either direction, and there were no adverse effects on depression or anxiety. All women who received the DA indicated they would recommend it to other WWE. The DA has the potential to serve as a useful support tool for WWE who are considering motherhood.

Enrolment for the trial ran between December, 2001, and July, 2006. Children were seen at one of two hospital centres or a residential centre for young people with epilepsy. Children were randomly assigned to receive a ketogenic diet, either immediately or after a 3-month delay, with no other changes to treatment (control group). Neither the family nor investigators were blinded to the group assignment. Early withdrawals were recorded, and seizure frequency on the diet was assessed after 3 months and compared with that of the controls. The primary endpoint was a reduction in seizures; analysis was intention to treat. Tolerability of the diet was assessed by questionnaire at 3 months. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00564915. 73 children were assigned to the ketogenic diet and 72 children to the control group. Data from 103 children were available for analysis: 54 on the ketogenic diet and 49 controls. Of those who did not complete the trial, 16 children did not receive their intervention, 16 did not provide adequate data, and ten withdrew from the treatment before the 3-month review, six because of intolerance. After 3 months, the mean percentage of baseline seizures was significantly lower in the diet group than in the controls (62.0%vs 136.9%, 75% decrease, 95% CI 42.4-107.4%; p<0.0001). 28 children (38%) in the diet group had greater than 50% seizure reduction compared with four (6%) controls (p<0.0001), and five children (7%) in the diet group had greater than 90% seizure reduction compared with no controls (p=0.0582).

This open-label, randomised clinical trial was undertaken at 30 UK emergency departments at secondary and tertiary care centres. Participants aged 6 months to under 18 years, with convulsive status epilepticus requiring second-line treatment, were randomly assigned (1:1) using a computer-generated randomisation schedule to receive levetiracetam (40 mg/kg over 5 min) or phenytoin (20 mg/kg over at least 20 min), stratified by centre.

{"id": 2417, "text": "Dravet syndrome is a rare, treatment-resistant developmental epileptic encephalopathy characterised by multiple types of frequent, disabling seizures. Fenfluramine has been reported to have antiseizure activity in observational studies of photosensitive epilepsy and Dravet syndrome. The aim of the present study was to assess the efficacy and safety of fenfluramine in patients with Dravet syndrome. In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, we enrolled children and young adults with Dravet syndrome. After a 6-week observation period to establish baseline monthly convulsive seizure frequency (MCSF; convulsive seizures were defined as hemiclonic, tonic, clonic, tonic-atonic, generalised tonic-clonic, and focal with clearly observable motor signs), patients were randomly assigned through an interactive web response system in a 1:1:1 ratio to placebo, fenfluramine 0·2 mg/kg per day, or fenfluramine 0·7 mg/kg per day, added to existing antiepileptic agents for 14 weeks. The primary outcome was the change in mean monthly frequency of convulsive seizures during the treatment period compared with baseline in the 0·7 mg/kg per day group versus placebo; 0·2 mg/kg per day versus placebo was assessed as a key secondary outcome. Analysis was by modified intention to treat. Safety analyses included all participants who received at least one dose of study medication. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov with two identical protocols NCT02682927 and NCT02826863. Between Jan 15, 2016, and Aug 14, 2017, we assessed 173 patients, of whom 119 patients (mean age 9·0 years, 64 [54%] male) were randomly assigned to receive either fenfluramine 0·2 mg/kg per day (39), fenfluramine 0·7 mg/kg per day (40) or placebo (40). During treatment, the median reduction in seizure frequency was 74·9% in the fenfluramine 0·7 mg/kg group (from median 20·7 seizures per 28 days to 4·7 seizures per 28 days), 42·3% in the fenfluramine 0·2 mg/kg group (from median 17·5 seizures per 28 days to 12·6 per 28 days), and 19·2% in the placebo group (from median 27·3 per 28 days to 22·0 per 28 days). The study met its primary efficacy endpoint, with fenfluramine 0·7 mg/kg per day showing a 62·3% greater reduction in mean MCSF compared with placebo (95% CI 47·7-72·8, p<0·0001); fenfluramine 0·2 mg/kg per day showed a 32·4% reduction in mean MCSF compared with placebo (95% CI 6·2-52·3, p=0·0209). The most common adverse events (occurring in at least 10% of patients and more frequently in the fenfluramine groups) were decreased appetite, diarrhoea, fatigue, lethargy, somnolence, and decreased weight. Echocardiographic examinations revealed valve function within the normal physiological range in all patients during the trial and no signs of pulmonary arterial hypertension. In Dravet syndrome, fenfluramine provided significantly greater reduction in convulsive seizure frequency compared with placebo and was generally well tolerated, with no observed valvular heart disease or pulmonary arterial hypertension. Fenfluramine could be an important new treatment option for patients with Dravet syndrome.

Patients were randomized to lacosamide 400 or 300 mg/day (3:1 ratio), starting at 200 mg/day and titrated over 3 weeks to randomized dose. Patients then withdrew background AEDs over 6 weeks and entered a 10-week Monotherapy Phase.

The case study RCT is the Standard and New Antiepileptic Drugs II (SANAD II) trial, a pragmatic, UK multicentre RCT assessing the clinical and cost-effectiveness of antiepileptic drugs as treatments for epilepsy. Ninety-eight of 470 eligible participants provided consent for access to routinely recorded secondary care data that were retrieved from NHS Digital Hospital Episode Statistics (N=71) and primary and secondary care data from The Secure Anonymised Information Linkage Databank (N=27). We assessed data items relevant to the identification of individuals eligible for inclusion in SANAD II, baseline and follow-up visits. The attributes of routinely recorded data were assessed including the degree of missing data. The agreement between routinely recorded data and data collected on case report forms in SANAD II was assessed using calculation of Cohen's kappa for categorical data and construction of Bland-Altman plots for continuous data. There was a significant degree of missing data in the routine record for 15 of the 20 variables assessed, including all clinical variables. Agreement was poor for the majority of comparisons, including the assessments of seizure occurrence and adverse events. For example, only 23/62 (37%) participants had a date of first-ever seizure identified in routine datasets. Agreement was satisfactory for the date of prescription of antiepileptic drugs and episodes of healthcare resource use. There are currently significant limitations preventing the use of routinely recorded data for participant identification and assessment of clinical outcomes in epilepsy, and potentially other chronic conditions.

From starting doses of 100 mg/day lacosamide or 200 mg/day carbamazepine-CR, uptitration to the first target level of 200 mg/day and 400 mg/day, respectively, took place over 2 weeks. After a 1-week stabilisation period, patients entered a 6-month assessment period. If a seizure occurred, the dose was titrated to the next target level (400 or 600 mg/day for lacosamide and 800 or 1200 mg/day for carbamazepine-CR) over 2 weeks with a 1-week stabilisation period, and the 6-month assessment period began again. Patients who completed 6 months of treatment and remained seizure-free entered a 6-month maintenance period on the same dose. The primary efficacy outcome was the proportion of patients remaining free from seizures for 6 consecutive months after stabilisation at the last assessed dose. The predefined non-inferiority criteria were -12% absolute and -20% relative difference between treatment groups. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01243177. The trial was done between April 27, 2011, and Aug 7, 2015. 888 patients were randomly assigned treatment. 444 patients taking lacosamide and 442 taking carbamazepine-CR were included in the full analysis set (took at least one dose of study treatment), and 408 and 397, respectively, were included in the per-protocol set. In the full analysis set, 327 (74%) patients in the lacosamide group and 308 (70%) in the carbamazepine-CR group completed 6 months of treatment without seizures. The proportion of patients in the full analysis set predicted by the Kaplan-Meier method to be seizure-free at 6 months was 90% taking lacosamide and 91% taking carbamazepine-CR (absolute treatment-difference: -1·3%, 95% CI -5·5 to 2·8 relative treatment difference: -6·0%). Kaplan-Meier estimates results were similar in the per-protocol set (92% and 93%; -1·3%, -5·3 to 2·7; -5·7%). Treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in 328 (74%) patients receiving lacosamide and 332 (75%) receiving carbamazepine-CR. 32 (7%) patients taking lacosamide and 43 (10%) taking carbamazepine-CR had serious treatment-emergent adverse events, and 47 (11%) and 69 (16%), respectively, had treatment-emergent adverse events that led to withdrawal. Treatment with lacosamide met the predefined non-inferiority criteria when compared with carbamazepine-CR. Therefore, it might be useful as first-line monotherapy for adults with newly diagnosed epilepsy.

The safety and tolerability of PER have been well-documented in three double-blind, randomized, placebo (PBO)-controlled Phase III studies and an open-label extension (OLE). This post hoc analysis evaluated the occurrence and characteristics of the most common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) associated with PER. Results from the Phase III studies were pooled; post hoc analyses on the double-blind phase and up to 1 year of the OLE were performed on the four most common TEAEs for which incidence was higher for PER than PBO. The four most common TEAEs were dizziness, somnolence, fatigue, and irritability. For most subjects in the Phase III double-blind studies, these TEAEs were observed during 6-week titration and were mild or moderate in severity. For severe AEs, no dose-response relationship was observed. Patients in the PBO group during Phase III (who therefore received their first PER treatment during OLE) experienced these TEAEs with incidence and timing similar to that of PER-treated patients in Phase III. The first onset of these TEAEs occurred during the early weeks of PER conversion in the OLE. After 6months and up to 1 year of PER treatment, low to no incidence of the first onset of the four TEAEs was observed. Post hoc analyses of data from pooled Phase III studies provide greater insight into occurrence/duration of TEAEs. Phase III double-blind and OLE data showed that dizziness, somnolence, fatigue, and irritability were the most common TEAEs reported by patients taking PER. Additionally, these results suggest consistency between studies in patient responses to onset of these TEAEs.

DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, INTERVENTIONS AND MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The multicentre UK-based Standard versus New Antiepileptic Drugs (SANAD) study was a randomised controlled trial assessing standard and new antiepileptic drugs for patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy. For participants aged at least 16 with a breakthrough seizure, data have been analysed to estimate the annual seizure recurrence risk following a period of 6, 9 and 12 months seizure freedom. Regression modelling was used to investigate how antiepileptic drug treatment and a number of clinical factors influence the risk of seizure recurrence. At 12 months following a breakthrough seizure, the overall unadjusted risk of a recurrence over the next 12 months is lower than 20%, risk 17% (95% CI 15% to 19%). However, some patient subgroups have been identified which have an annual recurrence risk significantly greater than 20% after an initial 12-month seizure-free period following a breakthrough seizure. This reanalysis of SANAD provides estimates of seizure recurrence risks following a breakthrough seizure that will inform policy and guidance about regaining an ordinary driving licence. Further guidance is needed as to how such data should be used. SANAD is registered with the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number Register ISRCTN38354748.", "labels": [[839, 896, "Patient"], [647, 649, "Patient"], [754, 762, "Control"], [767, 790, "Intervention"], [771, 790, "Control"], [795, 833, "Patient"], [1180, 1342, "Outcome"], [1353, 1543, "Outcome"]]}
{"id": 2416, "text": "Irritability is a adverse effect of many antiseizure medications (ASMs), but there are no validated measures currently available to characterize this behavioral risk. We examined both child and parent/guardian versions of the Affective Reactivity Index (ARI), a validated measure developed for application in adolescent psychiatry, to determine its sensitivity to ASM-related irritability. We hypothesized irritability increases associated with levetiracetam (LEV) but not lamotrigine (LTG) or oxcarbazepine (OXC). The ARI was administered to 71 child and parent/guardian pairs randomized to one of three common ASMs (LEV, LTG, OXC) used to treat new-onset focal (localization-related) epilepsy. Subjects were recruited as part of a prospective multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel group design. The ARI was administered at baseline prior to treatment initiation and again at 3 months after ASM initiation. There was a significant increase in ARI ratings for both child and parent/guardian ratings for LEV but not LTG or OXC when assessed 3 months after treatment initiation. When examined on the individual subject level using a criterion of at least a 3-point ARI increase, there was an increase associated with LEV for child ratings but not parent/guardian scores. Both child and parent/guardian versions of the ARI appear sensitive to medication-induced irritability associated with LEV on both the group and individual levels. The findings extend the applicability of ARI from characterizing the presence of clinical irritability as a psychiatric diagnostic feature to a more modifiable aspect of behavior change related to medication management and support its use in clinical trial applications.", "labels": [[543, 545, "N"], [546, 577, "Patient"], [647, 694, "Patient"], [618, 621, "Intervention"], [1011, 1014, "Intervention"], [445, 464, "Intervention"], [473, 513, "Control"], [623, 631, "Control"], [1023, 1033, "Control"], [1223, 1226, "Intervention"], [1396, 1399, "Intervention"], [916, 1083, "Outcome"], [226, 258, "Outcome"], [1085, 1275, "Outcome"], [1277, 1439, "Outcome_2nd"]]}

County-wide random digit dialing telephone surveys were supplemented with door-to-door recruitment in three Arizona border communities. Utilizing a two-step screening process, individuals with a seizure disorder or epilepsy were identified. A consensus diagnosis was arrived at after reviewing results from the detailed interview, medical records and clinical examination. A total of 15,738 household individuals were surveyed. Two hundred and three individuals were identified as having had epilepsy at some point in their life; 25% of them were previously not diagnosed. The sex and age-adjusted prevalence estimate was 14.3 per 1000 (95% CI: 12.5-16.1) for lifetime epilepsy, and 11.8 per 1000 (CI: 10.2-13.5) for active epilepsy (seizures in the past 5 years or currently taking antiseizure medications). Non-Hispanic Whites were two times more likely to have active epilepsy than Hispanics. The majority of individuals with lifetime history of epilepsy had idiopathic or cryptogenic epilepsy; most were localization-related epilepsy although the exact location could not be determined for the majority. Although most individuals with epilepsy report receiving care from a neurology specialist, they were more likely to have visited a non-specialist in the past 3 months. The lower prevalence of epilepsy among Hispanics compared to non-Hispanics supports previous survey findings in the Southwest US and may be due to language, acculturation factors, stigma, or a reflection of the healthy immigrant effect. The surprisingly high proportion of previously un-diagnosed individuals shows a need for further investigation as well as a need to increase community awareness.", "labels": [[533, 539, "N"], [80, 110, "Patient"]]}

{"id": 2238, "text": "In adults with intellectual disability (ID) and epilepsy there are suggestions that improvements in management may follow introduction of epilepsy nurse-led care. However, this has not been tested in a definitive clinical trial and results cannot be generalised from general population studies as epilepsy tends to be more severe and to involve additional clinical comorbidities in adults with ID. This trial investigates whether nurses with expertise in epilepsy and ID, working proactively to a clinically defined role, can improve clinical and quality of life outcomes in the management of epilepsy within this population, compared to treatment as usual. The trial also aims to establish whether any perceived benefits represent good value for money. The EpAID clinical trial is a two-arm cluster randomised controlled trial of nurse-led epilepsy management versus treatment as usual. This trial aims to obtain follow-up data from 320 participants with ID and drug-resistant epilepsy. Participants are randomly assigned either to a 'treatment as usual' control or a 'defined epilepsy nurse role' active arm, according to the cluster site at which they are treated. The active intervention utilises the recently developed Learning Disability Epilepsy Specialist Nurse Competency Framework for adults with ID. Participants undergo 4 weeks of baseline data collection, followed by a minimum of 20 weeks intervention (novel treatment or treatment as usual), followed by 4 weeks of follow-up data collection. The primary outcome is seizure severity, including associated injuries and the level of distress manifest by the patient in the preceding 4 weeks. Secondary outcomes include cost-utility analysis, carer strain, seizure frequency and side effects. Descriptive measures include demographic and clinical descriptors of participants and clinical services in which they receive their epilepsy management. Qualitative study of clinical interactions and semi-structured interviews with clinicians and participants' carers are also undertaken. The EpAID clinical trial is the first cluster randomised controlled trial to test possible benefits of a nurse-led intervention in adults with epilepsy and ID. This research will have important implications for ID and epilepsy services. The challenges of undertaking such a trial in this population, and the approaches to meeting these are discussed.

It is believed that VNS causes alterations in cytokines, which can lead to rebalancing the release of neurotoxic and neuroprotective tryptophan metabolites. We aimed to evaluate VNS effects on tryptophan metabolites and on epileptic seizures and investigated whether the antiepileptic effectiveness correlated with changes in tryptophan metabolism. Forty-one children with intractable epilepsy were included in a randomized, active-controlled, double-blind study. After a baseline period of 12 weeks, all children underwent implantation of a vagus nerve stimulator and entered a blinded active-controlled phase of 20 weeks. Half of the children received high-output (therapeutic) stimulation (n=21), while the other half received low-output (active control) stimulation (n=20). Subsequently, all children received high-output stimulation for another 19 weeks (add-on phase). Tryptophan metabolites were assessed in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by use of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and compared between high- and low-output groups and between the end of both study phases and baseline. Seizure frequency was recorded using seizure diaries. Mood was assessed using Profile of Mood States (POMS) questionnaires. Regarding tryptophan metabolites, anthranilic acid (AA) levels were significantly higher at the end of the add-on phase compared with baseline (p=0.002) and correlated significantly with improvement of mood (τ=-0.39, p=0.037) and seizure frequency reduction (τ=-0.33, p<0.01).

Adherence, self-efficacy (Epilepsy Self-Efficacy Scale [ESES]), quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), healthcare costs, production losses, and patient and family costs were assessed at baseline and during the 12-month study period.

Adherence, ESES, and quality of life did not differ significantly between groups. An ICER of €54 per point increase in ESES score at 6 months and €1,105 per point increase at 12-month follow-up was found.
