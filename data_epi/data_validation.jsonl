Forty consecutive patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy undergoing prolonged video-electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring at the Department of Neurology, Innsbruck Medical University were included and randomized to an intervention group (questionnaire results accessible to the physicians) and a control group (questionnaire results inaccessible to the physicians). Patients had to complete questionnaires on the day of admission (T0) and the day of discharge (T1). Overall, twenty-five patients (25/40, 62.5%) showed abnormal assessment results, twelve of them exclusively due to pathological scores on the Liverpool Adverse Events Profile (LAEP). Mean LAEP score was within the pathological range of 48.8 points (48.8 ± 7.2). The psychosocial burden with respect to the Performance, Socio-Demographic Aspects, Subjective Evaluation (PESOS) scale fear (48.7 ± 21.4) was also moderately affected. Moreover, mean anxiety (9.1 ± 4.4) and depression (7.6 ± 4.5) scores were both slightly abnormal. Quality of life (as measured using the Quality of Life Inventory in Epilepsy (QOLIE-31)) was moderately impaired (seizure worry: 46.5 ± 21.3, overall quality of life: 52.6 ± 18.6, well-being: 54.1 ± 16.3, energy-fatigue: 39.4 ± 14.7, cognitive functioning: 41.4 ± 19.5, medication effects: 46.2 ± 23.4, social functioning: 51.1 ± 20.8, and total score: 47.2 ± 12.3). Careful medical history-taking and patient-physician consultations alone failed to detect needs for psychological/psychiatric help in three out of 7 patients in the control group (42.8%). Changes over time in Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and QOLIE-31 scores were not significant. The use of ePROs was feasible and well accepted in the clinical setting.

In long-term extension studies with treatment for up to 24 months, symptomatic renal calculi were reported in 9/626 (1.4%) patients. Pooled safety data from all US/European clinical trials identified 15/1296 (1.2%) patients with symptomatic renal calculi during treatment for up to 8.7 years. Post-marketing surveillance revealed nine cases from 59 667 patient-years of exposure in the USA, and 14 from 709 294 patient-years of exposure in Japan; only one case occurred during concomitant topiramate and zonisamide treatment. No imbalance in electrolyte levels was found from 35 patients receiving such co-treatment in clinical trials.

Participants were randomized into one of two groups: ACT or yoga. Therapeutic effects were measured using seizure index (frequency x duration) and quality of life (Satisfaction with Life Scale, WHOQOL-BREF). The treatment protocols consisted of 12 hours of professional therapy distributed in two individual sessions, two group sessions during a 5-week period, and booster sessions at 6 and 12 months posttreatment. Seizure index was continuously assessed during the 3-month baseline and 12-month follow-up. Quality of life was measured after treatment and at the 6-month and 1-year follow-ups. The results indicate that both ACT and yoga significantly reduce seizure index and increase quality of life over time. ACT reduced seizure index significantly more as compared with yoga. Participants in both the ACT and yoga groups improved their quality of life significantly as measured by one of two quality-of-life instruments. The ACT group increased their quality of life significantly as compared with the yoga group as measured by the WHOQOL-BREF, and the yoga group increased their quality of life significantly as compared with the ACT group as measured by the SWLS.

The inclusion criteria were patients with newly diagnosed JME or previously diagnosed JME with a history of a poor response or adverse effects to other antiepileptic drugs. The primary endpoint of this study was percentage of patients who were free of myoclonic seizures for 24 weeks in the two groups. The frequency and severity of adverse effects were also assessed. Sixteen patients were randomized to topiramate and 17 to valproate. In the topiramate arm, 11 of 16 patients (68.9%) completed 24-week maintenance therapy and seven of the 11 (64%) were seizure-free. In the valproate arm, 16 of 17 patients (94.1%) completed 24-week follow-up and nine of 16 (56%) were seizure-free.

Perampanel 4-12 mg significantly prolonged median time to prerandomization monthly seizure count, generally by more than 1 week, compared with placebo, across all 3 studies, consistent with the original primary outcomes. Analysis of SG seizures only, and CP + SG seizures, also indicated a significantly prolonged median time to prerandomization monthly seizure count with perampanel 8 mg and 12 mg compared with placebo. Time to prerandomization monthly seizure count is a promising novel alternative to the standard endpoints of median percent change in seizure frequency and 50% responder rates used in trials of add-on AEDs.

In this trial, we assessed US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) bioequivalence standards by studying the effects of switching between two disparate generic immediate-release lamotrigine products in patients with epilepsy. The Equivalence among Generic Antiepileptic Drugs (EQUIGEN) chronic-dose study was a randomised, double-blind, crossover study that enrolled adults (aged ≥18 years) with epilepsy from six epilepsy centres at academic institutions across the USA who were receiving immediate-release lamotrigine dosed at 100 mg, 200 mg, 300 mg, or 400 mg twice daily. Eligible patients were randomly allocated (1:1) to one of two treatment sequences (sequence 1 or sequence 2), comprising four study periods of 14 days each. During each 14-day treatment period, patients received balanced doses of an oral generic lamotrigine product every 12 h (200-800 mg total, identical to lamotrigine dose prior to study enrolment); after each 14-day period, patients were crossed over to receive the other generic product. Computer-based randomisation was done using random permuted blocks of size two or four for each site to prevent sequence predictability. Both patients and study personnel were masked to the generic products selected, their predicted exposure (ie, high vs low), and their group allocation. The primary outcome of this trial was bioequivalence between the generic products, which was assessed at the end of the study through a comparison of maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) for each product in the analysis population (all patients who completed all four treatment periods). Bioequivalence was established if the 90% CIs of the ratios of these two parameters for the two products were within equivalence limits (80-125%) in the analysis population. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov\\, number NCT01713777. Between April 25, 2013, and Aug 12, 2014, 35 eligible patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to treatment sequence 1 (n=15) or treatment sequence 2 (n=20). 33 patients completed all four treatment periods and were included in the primary outcome analysis. The 90% CIs of the ratios of both Cmax and AUC were within equivalence limits (AUC 90% CI 98-103, Cmax 90% CI 99-105), showing that lamotrigine exposures were equivalent between the generic products. No significant changes in seizure frequency or adverse events were recorded. No deaths, study-related serious adverse events, or changes in clinical laboratory values or vital signs occurred during this study.

County-wide random digit dialing telephone surveys were supplemented with door-to-door recruitment in three Arizona border communities. Utilizing a two-step screening process, individuals with a seizure disorder or epilepsy were identified. A consensus diagnosis was arrived at after reviewing results from the detailed interview, medical records and clinical examination. A total of 15,738 household individuals were surveyed. Two hundred and three individuals were identified as having had epilepsy at some point in their life; 25% of them were previously not diagnosed. The sex and age-adjusted prevalence estimate was 14.3 per 1000 (95% CI: 12.5-16.1) for lifetime epilepsy, and 11.8 per 1000 (CI: 10.2-13.5) for active epilepsy (seizures in the past 5 years or currently taking antiseizure medications). Non-Hispanic Whites were two times more likely to have active epilepsy than Hispanics. The majority of individuals with lifetime history of epilepsy had idiopathic or cryptogenic epilepsy; most were localization-related epilepsy although the exact location could not be determined for the majority. Although most individuals with epilepsy report receiving care from a neurology specialist, they were more likely to have visited a non-specialist in the past 3 months. The lower prevalence of epilepsy among Hispanics compared to non-Hispanics supports previous survey findings in the Southwest US and may be due to language, acculturation factors, stigma, or a reflection of the healthy immigrant effect.

Enrolment for the trial ran between December, 2001, and July, 2006. Children were seen at one of two hospital centres or a residential centre for young people with epilepsy. Children were randomly assigned to receive a ketogenic diet, either immediately or after a 3-month delay, with no other changes to treatment (control group). Neither the family nor investigators were blinded to the group assignment. Early withdrawals were recorded, and seizure frequency on the diet was assessed after 3 months and compared with that of the controls. The primary endpoint was a reduction in seizures; analysis was intention to treat. Tolerability of the diet was assessed by questionnaire at 3 months. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00564915. 73 children were assigned to the ketogenic diet and 72 children to the control group. Data from 103 children were available for analysis: 54 on the ketogenic diet and 49 controls. Of those who did not complete the trial, 16 children did not receive their intervention, 16 did not provide adequate data, and ten withdrew from the treatment before the 3-month review, six because of intolerance. After 3 months, the mean percentage of baseline seizures was significantly lower in the diet group than in the controls (62.0%vs 136.9%, 75% decrease, 95% CI 42.4-107.4%; p<0.0001). 28 children (38%) in the diet group had greater than 50% seizure reduction compared with four (6%) controls (p<0.0001), and five children (7%) in the diet group had greater than 90% seizure reduction compared with no controls (p=0.0582).

The physician chose VPA or CBZ as preferred standard treatment; patients were randomized to standard AEDs or LEV. The primary endpoint was time to treatment withdrawal. Results are exploratory, since KOMET was not powered for a subgroup analysis by age.

It is extensively converted after oral administration to eslicarbazepine, and is believed to exert its effect through inhibition of voltage-gated sodium channels. The possible role of ESL as monotherapy to treat POS has not yet been established. This study was an 18-week, multicenter, randomized double-blind trial of gradual conversion to ESL monotherapy in adults with POS not well controlled by 1-2 antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), using historical data as the control. The study comprised an 8-week baseline period, a 2-week titration period, a 6-week AED conversion period, a 10-week monotherapy period, and either a 1-week taper period or optional entry to an open-label extension study. The primary endpoint compared the Kaplan-Meier (KM)-estimated 112-day exit rate with a threshold value calculated from the historical controls. There were 172 randomized patients; 154 (90%) entered the AED conversion period and 121 (70%) completed the study. The KM-estimated exit rates [confidence interval (CI)] were 15.6% [8.1-28.7%] for ESL 1200 mg, and 12.8% [7.5-21.5%] for ESL 1600 mg. The upper limits of the 95% CI KM-estimates were below the pre-specified threshold for historical control of 65.3%, indicating that ESL was efficacious in reducing seizure-related exits, compared with historical control.

{"id": 2229, "text": "Parents of children with epilepsy and other neurological conditions live with a feeling of constant uncertainty. The uncertainty associated with caring for a child with a neurological condition produces stress, which leads to decreased parental belief in caregiving skills, anxiety, and depression, ultimately altering parental functioning resulting in an increase in child behavioral problems. The stress associated with caring for children with neurological conditions is unlike caring for children with other chronic conditions. Neurological conditions are unpredictable, and there are often no warning signs before an acute event. This unpredictability accompanied with stigma results in social isolation and impacts family functioning. In addition, children with neurological conditions have a higher rate of psychological comorbidities and behavior problems when compared with children with other chronic conditions. This produces an additional burden on the parents and family. This randomized controlled trial tested the efficacy of the Creating Opportunities for Parent Empowerment intervention for parents of children with epilepsy and other neurological conditions. This intervention was administered at three intervals: (a) during hospital admission, (b) 3 days after hospital discharge by telephone, and (c) 4-6 weeks after hospital discharge. Forty-six parents of children admitted to the inpatient neuroscience unit at Boston Children's Hospital participated in the study. Several study limitations resulted in an inadequate sample size to obtain the power necessary to reach statistically significant results for most of the research questions. A one-between, one-within multivariate analysis of variance revealed that the main effect of time was significant for differences in state anxiety for both the usual care group and the intervention group, F(1, 20) = 9.86, p = .005, indicating that state anxiety for both groups combined was more pronounced during the hospitalization. A one-between, one-within multivariate analysis of variance showed that the effect of the interaction between time and group was significant for internalized behavior assessment system score only (p = .037) because the usual care group reported a significant decrease in internalizing behavior scores in their children over time. Findings from this study have significant implications for clinical practice and future research.

In photosensitive JME subjects, we also performed a dynamic evaluation of BOLD signal changes evoked by the photoparoxysmal response (PPR) in a time frame ranging from 10 s before the onset of the EEG paroxysm up until 10 s afterward. The IPS evoked a positive BOLD response in striate and extrastriate visual areas, which was less in JME patients than in controls. Moreover, people with JME had a reduced positive BOLD response in the frontoparietal areas and putamen but a stronger negative BOLD response in the primary sensorimotor cortex (SM1) and in cortical regions belonging to the default mode network (DMN). In JME, the dynamic evaluation of BOLD signal changes related to PPR revealed an early positive response in the putamen and SM1, followed by BOLD signal decrements in the putamen, caudate nuclei, thalami, and SM1.

While the benefit of playing Mozart K.448 music has been studied as an alternative, supplementary, nonpharmacologic treatment for epilepsy, the literature features limited few randomized controlled trial studies of children. We aimed to study the effect of Mozart K.448 for two pianos on interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs), quantitative electroencephalogram (qEEG), and heart rate variability (HRV) in patients with epilepsy. We employed a single-blinded randomized trial design with a placebo control. The treatment group listened to the first 8 min of Mozart K.448 for two pianos during EEG recording. The control group underwent an EEG recording of the same duration in a quiet environment. Interictal epileptiform discharges were manually counted for 8 min before, during, and after the song was plated. Quantitative electroencephalogram and HRV were analyzed in each period. A total of 32 patients aged 0-18 years were enrolled. There were 12 patients in the music group and 14 patients in the control group; 67% of the patients in the former exhibited significantly decreased IEDs while listening to the music compared with 42% of the patients in the quiet group (RR [Relative Risk Reduction]: 0.72, p-value: <0.001, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.69-0.74). During music exposure, qEEG demonstrated an increase in the delta/theta to alpha/beta ratio relative to that of controls (median in music: +3% and control: -6%, p-value: 0.520). Heart rate variability analyses showed a decrease in the ratio of low frequency to high frequency (LF/HF), which represents parasympathetic activity during music exposure (decrease of 34%, p-value: 0.382). The present study showed that Mozart K.448 reduced the number of IEDs in children with epilepsy and that Mozart K.448 could enhance parasympathetic activity.

Patients completing the double-blind treatment (6-week titration, 13-week maintenance) with placebo (DB-PBO) or perampanel (DB-PER) began the extension study with a 16-week blinded conversion period, during which DB-PBO patients were switched to perampanel. Doses were titrated in 2-mg increments (biweekly) to an individualized maximum tolerated dose of perampanel (up to 12 mg/day). Patients then entered a planned, open-label treatment period. Perampanel treatment during the extension study reduced total seizure frequency/28 days relative to the double-blind prerandomization baseline regardless of prior perampanel or placebo treatment in the core studies.

The aim of the trial is to determine prospectively if ioECoG-tailored surgery using HFOs, instead of interictal spikes, is feasible and will lead to an equal or better seizure outcome. METHODS\\ We present a single-blinded multi-center randomized controlled trial The HFO Trial including patients with refractory focal epilepsy of all ages who undergo surgery with intra-operative electrocorticography. Surgery is tailored by HFOs (arm 1) or interictal spikes (arm 2) in the intra-operative electrocorticography. Primary outcome is post-operative outcome after 1 year, dichotomized in seizure freedom (Engel 1A and 1B) versus seizure recurrence (Engel 1C-4). Secondary outcome measures are the volume of resected tissue, neurologic deficits, surgical duration and complications, cognition and quality of life. The trial has a non-inferiority design to test feasibility and at least equal performance in terms of surgical outcome. We aim to include 78 patients within 3 years including 1 year follow-up. Results are expected in 2018. This trial provides a transition from observational research towards clinical interventions using HFOs. We address methodological difficulties in designing this trial. We expect that the use of HFOs as a biomarker for tailoring will increase the success rate of epilepsy surgery while reducing resection volume. This may reduce neurological deficits and yield a better quality of life. Future technical developments, such as validated automatic online HFO identification, could, together with the attained clinical knowledge, lead to a new objective tailoring approach in epilepsy surgery.

Thirty eight patients were randomly allocated equally to allopurinol+preexisting antiepileptic (Group A) or placebo+preexisting antiepileptic (Group B) for a 6-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The dose of allopurinol was titrated up to 300 mg/day (100 mg TDS). The dose of preexisting medications was maintained without change over the trial. The effect of allopurinol was evaluated by a reduction in the total number of seizures per month and duration of seizure attacks. Of 38 participants, 32 patients completed the study. There were significant differences between the two groups in terms of reduction in the total number of seizure over the trial. Seizures reduction of >30% in 66%, >50% in 55%, and >60% in 44% of cases in the allopurinol group was achieved after 2 months and persisted during the study. Nevertheless, only during month 4 was there a significant difference between the two groups regarding reduction in seizure duration. In the allopurinol group, two patients had transient rashes, two patients had mild nausea, and two experienced dizziness, but only one patient discontinued the drug due to dizziness. In the placebo group, one patient had rash and one patient had nausea. In addition, no significant hematological or hepatic changes were found during the trial in both groups. The results suggest allopurinol as a safe and effective adjuvant agent in refractory epilepsy. Based on this study, we suggest that purine metabolism pathways and the specific use of allopurinol should be further investigated with regards to neurobiology and treatment of refractory epilepsy.", "labels": [[365, 367, "N"], [368, 401, "Patient"], [329, 361, "Intervention"], [584, 602, "Control"], [774, 785, "Intervention"], [943, 1068, "Outcome"], [1364, 1385, "Intervention"], [1547, 1564, "Control"], [1740, 1751, "Intervention"], [1896, 1914, "Intervention"], [263, 281, "Control"], [460, 507, "Intervention"], [511, 554, "Control"], [610, 676, "Intervention"], [1070, 1226, "Outcome"], [1146, 1167, "Intervention"], [1242, 1359, "Outcome"], [1361, 1542, "Outcome_2nd"], [1544, 1613, "Outcome_2nd"], [1628, 1718, "Outcome_2nd"], [1794, 1813, "Patient"], [1992, 2011, "Patient"]]}

Synapses can be bi-directionally modifiable via potentiation (long-term potentiation, LTP) or depotentiation (long-term depression, LTD) of synaptic transmission efficacy, and the phosphorylation state of Ser831 and Ser845 sites, in the GluA1 subunit of the glutamate AMPA receptors, are a critical event for these synaptic neuroplasticity events.

Mean sleep efficiency improved significantly in both treatment groups in the mean baseline to endpoint change; there was no significant between-group difference. Pregabalin treatment was associated with a significant reduction in number of awakenings (p = 0.02), and improvement in wake time after sleep onset approached significance (p = 0.055), suggesting improvement in sleep continuity that was not observed in the placebo group. Pregabalin was also associated with significant improvements in the MOS sleep disturbance and sleep quantity subscales compared with placebo (p < or =0.03). There were no changes in self-reported seizure control. This exploratory pilot study suggests that pregabalin may improve sleep continuity in patients with clinically relevant sleep disturbance.
