{"id": 2024, "text": "The purpose of this work was to determine in a clinical trial the efficacy of reducing or preventing seizures in patients with neurological handicaps through sustained cortical activation evoked by passive exposure to a specific auditory stimulus (particular music). The specific type of stimulation had been determined in previous studies to evoke anti-epileptiform/anti-seizure brain activity. The study was conducted at the Thad E. Saleeby Center in Harstville, South Carolina, which is a permanent residence for individuals with heterogeneous neurological impairments, many with epilepsy. We investigated the ability to reduce or prevent seizures in subjects through cortical stimulation from sustained passive nightly exposure to a specific auditory stimulus (music) in a three-year randomized controlled study. In year 1, baseline seizure rates were established. In year 2, subjects were randomly assigned to treatment and control groups. Treatment group subjects were exposed during sleeping hours to specific music at regular intervals. Control subjects received no music exposure and were maintained on regular anti-seizure medication. In year 3, music treatment was terminated and seizure rates followed. We found a significant treatment effect (p = 0.024) during the treatment phase persisting through the follow-up phase (p = 0.002). Subjects exposed to treatment exhibited a significant 24% decrease in seizures during the treatment phase, and a 33% decrease persisting through the follow-up phase. Twenty-four percent of treatment subjects exhibited a complete absence of seizures during treatment. Exposure to specific auditory stimuli (i.e. music) can significantly reduce seizures in subjects with a range of epilepsy and seizure types, in some cases achieving a complete cessation of seizures. These results are consistent with previous work showing reductions in epileptiform activity from particular music exposure and offers potential for achieving a non-invasive, non-pharmacologic treatment of epilepsy.

Infants were stratified by age and randomly assigned to one of four topiramate target dose groups (3-, 5-, 15-, or 25 mg/kg/day). Treatment was initiated at 3 mg/kg/day with titration to the target dose by weekly dose escalation. Topiramate was administered daily in two divided doses as oral liquid (5 mg/ml for infants <9 kg or those who could not tolerate solid foods) or sprinkle capsule (25 mg) formulations. Following seven consecutive days of topiramate administration at the target dose, four blood samples were collected from each infant for pharmacokinetic assessments (predose, 1-3, 4-6, and 8-10 h postdose). Fifty-five infants (mean [SD] age in months: 11.4 [5.79]) with POS were enrolled, of whom 33% had seizures with or without secondary generalization.

Study medications were titrated to clinical response, and subjects remained in the trial unless they reached a treatment failure criterion. Maximal target doses were ethosuximide 60 mg/kg/day or 2,000 mg/day, valproic acid 60 mg/kg/day or 3,000 mg/day, and lamotrigine 12 mg/kg/day or 600 mg/day. Original primary outcome was at 16-20 weeks and included a video-electroencephalography (EEG) assessment. For this report, the main effectiveness outcome was the freedom from failure rate 12 months after randomization and included a video-EEG assessment; differential drug effects were determined by pairwise comparisons. The main cognitive outcome was the percentage of subjects experiencing attentional dysfunction at the month 12 visit. A total of 453 children were enrolled and randomized; 7 were deemed ineligible and 446 subjects comprised the overall efficacy cohort. There were no demographic differences between the three cohorts. By 12 months after starting therapy, only 37% of all enrolled subjects were free from treatment failure on their first medication. At the month 12 visit, the freedom-from-failure rates for ethosuximide and valproic acid were similar (45% and 44%, respectively; odds ratio [OR]with valproic acid vs. ethosuximide 0.94; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.58-1.52; p = 0.82) and were higher than the rate for lamotrigine (21%; OR with ethosuximide vs. lamotrigine 3.08; 95% CI 1.81-5.33; OR with valproic acid vs. lamotrigine 2.88; 95% CI 1.68-5.02; p < 0.001 for both comparisons). The frequency of treatment failures due to lack of seizure control (p < 0.001) and intolerable adverse events (p < 0.037) was significantly different among the treatment groups. Almost two thirds of the 125 subjects with treatment failure due to lack of seizure control were in the lamotrigine cohort. The largest subgroup (42%) of the 115 subjects discontinuing due to adverse events was in the valproic acid group. The previously reported higher rate of attentional dysfunction seen at 16-20 weeks in the valproic acid group compared with the ethosuximide or lamotrigine groups persisted at 12 months (p < 0.01). As initial monotherapy, the superior effectiveness of ethosuximide and valproic acid compared to lamotrigine in controlling seizures without intolerable adverse events noted at 16-20 weeks persisted at 12 months. The valproic acid cohort experienced a higher rate of adverse events leading to drug discontinuation as well as significant negative effects on attentional measures that were not seen in the ethosuximide cohort. These 12-month outcome data coupled with the study's prespecified decision-making algorithm indicate that ethosuximide is the optimal initial empirical monotherapy for CAE.

{"id": 2038, "text": "Assessing the functional reserve of key memory structures in the medial temporal lobes (MTL) of pre-surgical patients with intractable temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) remains a challenge. Conventional functional MRI (fMRI) memory paradigms have yet to fully convince of their ability to confidently assess the risk of a post-surgical amnesia. An alternative fMRI analysis method, multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA), focuses on the patterns of activity across voxels in specific brain regions that are associated with individual memory traces. This method makes it possible to investigate whether the hippocampus and related structures contralateral to any proposed surgery are capable of laying down and representing specific memories. Here we used MVPA-fMRI to assess the functional integrity of the hippocampi and MTL in patients with long-standing medically refractory TLE associated with unilateral hippocampal sclerosis (HS). Patients were exposed to movie clips of everyday events prior to scanning, which they subsequently recalled during high-resolution fMRI. MTL structures were delineated and pattern classifiers were trained to learn the patterns of brain activity across voxels associated with each memory. Predictable patterns of activity across voxels associated with specific memories could be detected in MTL structures, including the hippocampus, on the side contralateral to the HS, indicating their functional viability. By contrast, no discernible memory representations were apparent in the sclerotic hippocampus, but adjacent MTL regions contained detectable information about the memories. These findings suggest that MVPA in fMRI memory studies of TLE can indicate hippocampal functional reserve and may be useful to predict the effects of hippocampal resection in individual patients.", "labels": [[377, 405, "Intervention"], [747, 756, "Intervention"], [198, 212, "Intervention"], [821, 927, "Patient"]]}

This is a double-blind randomized active-control trial in DRE. Fifty subjects with 2 or more partial onset seizures per month (complex partial or tonic-clonic) entered a 6-week baseline period, and then were evaluated at 6, 12, and 18 weeks during the acute treatment period. Subjects were randomized to treatment (eTNS 120 Hz) or control (eTNS 2 Hz) parameters. At entry, subjects were highly drug-resistant, averaging 8.7 seizures per month (treatment group) and 4.8 seizures per month (active controls). On average, subjects failed 3.35 antiepileptic drugs prior to enrollment, with an average duration of epilepsy of 21.5 years (treatment group) and 23.7 years (active control group), respectively. eTNS was well-tolerated. Side effects included anxiety (4%), headache (4%), and skin irritation (14%). The responder rate, defined as >50% reduction in seizure frequency, was 30.2% for the treatment group vs 21.1% for the active control group for the 18-week treatment period (not significant, p = 0.31, generalized estimating equation [GEE] model). The treatment group experienced a significant within-group improvement in responder rate over the 18-week treatment period (from 17.8% at 6 weeks to 40.5% at 18 weeks, p = 0.01, GEE). Subjects in the treatment group were more likely to respond than patients randomized to control (odds ratio 1.73, confidence interval 0.59-0.51). eTNS was associated with reductions in seizure frequency as measured by the response ratio (p = 0.04, analysis of variance [ANOVA]), and improvements in mood on the Beck Depression Inventory (p = 0.02, ANOVA). This study provides preliminary evidence that eTNS is safe and may be effective in subjects with DRE. Side effects were primarily limited to anxiety, headache, and skin irritation.

Twenty-eight patients with epilepsy underwent CSM by the use of visual, auditory, and sentence-completion tasks. Hierarchical logistic regression analyzed errors to identify language sites and provide modality-specific percentages within subregions. The percentage of sites classified as language sites based on auditory naming was twice as high in anterior temporal regions compared with visual naming, marginally higher in posterior temporal areas, and comparable in parietal regions. Sentence completion was comparable to visual and auditory naming in parietal regions and lower in most temporal areas. Of 470 sites tested with both visual and auditory naming, 95 sites were distinctly auditory, whereas 48 sites were distinctly visual. The remaining sites overlapped. Distinct cortical areas were found for distinct input modalities, with language sites in anterior tip regions found most often by using auditory naming. The vulnerability of anterior temporal tip regions to resection in this population and distinct sites for each modality suggest that a multimodality approach may be needed to spare crucial language sites, if sparing those sites can be shown to significantly reduce the rate of postoperative language deficits without sacrificing seizure control.", "labels": [[488, 500, "N"], [501, 523, "Patient"], [552, 599, "Intervention"]]}

Subjects who failed epilepsy surgery or were not candidates for epilepsy surgery or were non-responders of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) took part in this study. The trial was completed by 77 subjects randomly assigned to 2 arms: control (AEDs) and reflexology (AEDs + reflexology therapy). The hypothesis was that hand reflexology therapy could produce results similar to those of vagus nerve stimulation, and foot reflexology therapy could maintain homeostasis in the functional status of individual body parts. Reflexology therapy was applied by family members. The follow-up period was 1.5 years. Quality of life in epilepsy patients was assessed with the QOLIE-31 instrument. In the reflexology group, the median baseline seizure frequency decreased from 9.5 (range 2-120) to 2 (range 0-110) with statistical significance (p < 0.001). In the control arm, the decrease was less than 25% with a baseline value of 16 (range 2-150). The pretherapy QOLIE-31 scores in the control group and the reflexology group were 41.05 ± 7 and 43.6 ± 8, respectively. Posttherapy data were 49.07 ± 6 and 65.4 ± 9, respectively (p < 0.002).

A partial response was defined as a reduction in the SPR of at least three units at three separate time points following ICA-105665 compared to the same time points following placebo with no time points with more than three units of increase. Complete suppression was defined by no PPRs in any eye condition at one or more time points. Six individual patients participated in the first three cohorts (100, 200, and 400 mg).

{"id": 2065, "text": "Although there is a general paucity of published pharmacokinetic (PK) data for new antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), PK analyses of pooled data from clinical studies of perampanel have recently been presented. We present PK/pharmacodynamic (PD) analyses of pooled data from phase III studies of perampanel describing efficacy and safety as a function of exposure, in order to determine whether a predictable concentration-effect relationship exists for perampanel efficacy and/or adverse events (AEs). The effects of concomitant enzyme-inducing AEDs (EIAEDs) and non-enzyme-inducing AEDs on the exposure, efficacy, and safety of perampanel are also considered. Three multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III studies investigated the efficacy and safety of perampanel 2-12 mg in patients with uncontrolled partial-onset seizures despite prior therapy with two or more AEDs. From baseline onward, patients also received ongoing treatment with stable doses of one to three approved concomitant AEDs. AEs were monitored throughout the studies. Changes from baseline in seizure frequency and 50% responder rates were evaluated. Exposure to perampanel was predicted based on the actual (last) dose using a previously established PK model. A population PK/PD model for the relationship between perampanel exposure and seizure frequency was estimated using nonlinear mixed-effect modeling with first-order conditional estimation, whereas logistic analyses for responder rate and AEs were performed using SAS analysis software. The PK/PD population included 1,109 patients. Seizure frequency decreased linearly as predicted perampanel average steady-state plasma concentrations increased. Concomitant EIAEDs (carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, and phenytoin) reduced exposure to perampanel but had no effect on the slope of the PD model-predicted relationship between exposure and reduction in seizure frequency. The probability of patients achieving a response was predicted to increase as perampanel average plasma concentration at steady state increased. No demographic, AED, region, or study covariate had any effect on the probability of achieving a positive treatment response to perampanel or on the slope of the exposure-response curve. Across the phase III studies, there were reports of dizziness (32.9%), somnolence (21.7%), fatigue (13.9%), irritability (12.3%), gait disturbance (9.1%), weight increase (6.1%), dysarthria (4.5%), and euphoric mood (0.5%); the model-predicted probability of these AEs increased significantly at higher exposure to perampanel (all p < 0.001). There was no effect of demographic variables or region on the probability of experiencing any of the AEs analyzed. PK and PD analyses have played a pivotal role in the clinical development of perampanel as an adjunctive treatment for pharmacoresistant partial-onset seizures. Phase III data suggest that a significant relationship exists between increases in perampanel plasma concentration (i.e., systemic exposure) and reductions in seizure frequency. In addition, increases in perampanel plasma concentration may potentially be associated with increases in AE rates. The model-predicted concentration-safety profile of perampanel does not appear to be affected by patient age, gender, or ethnicity. Although concomitant EIAEDs may influence perampanel PK, they do not appear to alter the relationship between perampanel plasma concentration and seizure frequency. Understanding these relationships between perampanel plasma concentration and clinical response will be valuable in utilizing this novel AED.", "labels": [[1570, 1575, "N"], [777, 795, "Intervention"], [799, 892, "Patient"], [700, 718, "Control"], [289, 299, "Intervention"]]}

Data were combined from Studies 301 and 302, which were both randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, parallel-group studies with similar inclusion and exclusion criteria. All patients had partial-onset seizures and were receiving 1 to 3 concomitant AEDs. Systemic exposure was predicted for each patient as the average steady-state AUC0-τ during the 12-week maintenance phase, based on a population pharmacokinetic model developed for retigabine/ezogabine. Efficacy end points included reduction in total partial-seizure frequency from baseline and probability of ≥50% reduction from baseline in seizure frequency. The probabilities of occurrence of 6 AEs were also evaluated. AUC0-τ values increased linearly over the 600- to 1200-mg/d dose range. Over the entire AUC0-τ range, the probability of efficacy was greater than that for any AE. The slopes of the exposure-response relationship for probability of dizziness and abnormal coordination were similar to that for efficacy, whereas the slopes for dysarthria, somnolence, tremor, and blurred vision were shallower, indicating that the probability of these events occurring was less affected than the probability of efficacy by increases in retigabine/ezogabine AUC0-τ. Based on the summary statistics of pharmacokinetic parameters, systemic exposure to retigabine/ezogabine increased linearly with dose (600-1200 mg/d). Population pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics showed that the probability of efficacy and AEs increased with increasing systemic retigabine/ezogabine exposure, and the probability of efficacy was higher than the probability of any of the AEs.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the diazepam AI when administered by caregivers to control an episode of ARS (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00319501). In this phase III, randomized, double‐blind, parallel‐group, placebo‐controlled, multicenter study, subjects with epilepsy on a stable antiepileptic drug regimen who required intermittent medical intervention to control ARS were randomized 1:1 to the placebo AI or the diazepam AI group. Subjects were stratified according to age (2–5, 6–11, ≥12 years). Dose (5, 10, 15, or 20 mg) was based on age and weight. A single dose of study medication was dispensed to be administered by caregivers in an outpatient setting when required. The primary end point was time to next seizure or rescue from 15 min to 12 h postdose. Secondary end points included rescue medication use, number of seizures postdose, caregiver and physician treatment assessments, and safety measures. Of 234 subjects randomized, 81/110 in the placebo AI group and 82/124 in the diazepam AI group were included in the intent‐to‐treat analysis. Baseline characteristics were similar for both groups. Time to next seizure or rescue was significantly longer in the diazepam AI group compared with the placebo AI group, with a hazard ratio of 0.55 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.34–0.88; p = 0.012) for diazepam AI versus placebo AI, adjusted for age group.

This was a phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo (PBO)-controlled flexible dose trial (N01254/NCT00504881) in adults (16-70 years) with uncontrolled epilepsy (up to 20% could be patients with generalized epilepsy). After a prospective 4-week baseline, patients were randomized (3:1) to b.i.d. BRV or PBO, initiated at 20 mg/day and increased, as needed, to 150 mg/day during an 8-week dose-finding period. This was followed by an 8-week stable-dose maintenance period. The treatment period comprised the dose-finding period plus the maintenance period (16 weeks). A total of 480 patients were randomized (BRV 359, PBO 121); of these, 431 had focal epilepsy and 49 had generalized epilepsy. Ninety percent BRV- and 91.7% PBO-treated patients completed the study. Similar proportions of patients (BRV 66.0%, PBO 65.3%) reported adverse events (AEs) during the treatment period. AEs led to treatment discontinuation in 6.1% and 5.0% of BRV- and PBO-treated patients, respectively. The incidence of AEs declined from the dose-finding (BRV 56.0%, PBO 55.4%) to the maintenance (BRV 36.8%, PBO 40.9%) period. The most frequent AEs during the treatment period were headache (BRV 14.2% vs. PBO 19.8%), somnolence (BRV 11.1% vs. PBO 4.1%), and dizziness (BRV 8.6% vs. PBO 5.8%). The incidence of psychiatric AEs was similar for BRV and PBO (BRV 12.3%, PBO 11.6%).

An intervention package with four components (intensive education, consultation services, maintenance of an epilepsy tracking card, and repeated reminders) was formulated. Medical compliance included antiepileptic drug (AED) adherence and lifestyle; each was graded on a 6-point scale with possible scores.

This was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial conducted across Europe and India. Eligible patients had two or more focal seizures/month for 3 months prior to screening and eight or more focal seizures during the 8-week prospective baseline. Concomitant use of levetiracetam was limited to 20% of randomized patients. Patients were randomized (1:1:1:1) to BRV 20, 50, 100 mg/day or PBO with no up-titration for 12 weeks, followed by down-titration or entry into a long-term follow-up study. The primary efficacy end point was percent reduction over PBO in baseline-adjusted focal seizure frequency/week over the 12-week treatment period. Comparison of BRV with PBO was sequential to control for multiplicity (50, 100, 20 mg/day), and thus required BRV to demonstrate superiority over PBO at 50 mg/day to meet the primary efficacy end point. Secondary efficacy variables were median percent reduction from baseline in focal seizure frequency/week, ≥50% responder rate, and seizure freedom (all seizure types). Safety assessments included treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). Of 399 randomized patients, 398 were included in the intent-to-treat (ITT) and safety populations.

We examined 12 patients whose absence seizures were induced by hyperventilation using video electroencephalographic recording for at least 4h.

Eight out of twelve patients were also examined in room air through pretreatment with carbogen for 3 min before the 3 min hyperventilation. Compared with hyperventilation in room air, hyperventilation supplemented with 5% CO2 had the following effects: (a) decrease in the number and duration of seizures; (b) prolonged appearance of epileptic discharges; and (c) reduction in the number and duration of SWDs (P<0.001). However, pretreatment with 5% CO2 and 100% O2 supplement did not yield similar effects. We demonstrated that 5% CO2 could suppress hyperventilation-induced absence seizures and SWDs, supporting the claim that 5% CO2 is an effective anticonvulsant agent.

We evaluated two marketed and effective AEDs-one narrow-spectrum [carbamazepine (CBZ)], and one broad-spectrum [levetiracetam (LEV)]-using a novel double-blinded, cross-over outpatient version of the trial to detect acute drug effects of the two marketed AEDs on photosensitivity.

The Prospective, Randomized Study of OXC XR in Subjects with Partial Epilepsy Refractory (PROSPER) study was a multinational, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group Phase 3 study. The primary efficacy endpoint was median percent reduction from baseline in monthly (28-day) seizure frequency for the 16-week double-blind treatment period in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population with analyzable seizure data. Other efficacy analyses included proportion of patients with ≥ 50% seizure reduction, proportion of patients seizure free, and the relationship between clinical response and plasma concentration. Median percent reduction was -28.7% for placebo, -38.2% (P = 0.08 vs placebo) for once-daily SPN-804 1200 mg, and -42.9% (P = 0.003) for SPN-804 2400 mg.

Seven hundred thirty-eight people with epilepsy (PWE) and their designated supporter were randomized to either the intervention (education) or nonintervention group. Data were collected at baseline and 1 year after the education intervention was administered to the intervention group. There were 581 PWE assessed at both time points. At the end of the study, 105 PWE from the intervention group and 86 from the nonintervention group gave blood samples, which were assayed for the most commonly used AEDs (phenobarbital, phenytoin, and carbamazepine). The proportions of PWE with detectable AED levels were determined using a standard blood assay method. The laboratory technicians conducting the assays were blinded to the randomization. Secondary outcomes were evaluated using questionnaires administered by trained field staff. Modified Poisson regression was used to investigate the factors associated with improved adherence (transition from nonoptimal AED level in blood at baseline to optimal levels at follow-up), reduced seizures, and improved KEBAS, which was done as a post hoc analysis. This trial is registered in ISRCTN register under ISRCTN35680481. There was no significant difference in adherence to AEDs based on detectable drug levels (odds ratio [OR] 1.46, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.74-2.90, p = 0.28) or by self-reports (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.71-1.40, p = 1.00) between the intervention and nonintervention group.

The number of patients with less frequent seizures (≤3 seizures in the last 3 months) increased in the intervention group (62-80% [p = 0.002]) and in the nonintervention group (67-75% [p = 0.04]). Improved therapeutic adherence (observed in both groups combined) was positively associated with positive change in beliefs about risks of epilepsy (relative risk [RR] 2.00, 95% CI 1.03-3.95) and having nontraditional religious beliefs (RR 2.01, 95% CI 1.01-3.99).

{"id": 2094, "text": "We aimed to develop and validate a Chinese version of the Neuropsychiatry Unit Cognitive Assessment Tool (NUCOG) for use in Chinese-speaking subjects internationally. Patients and healthy controls were recruited from two hospitals between July and October 2012. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were utilized to test criterion validity. Convergent validity was assessed via correlations between NUCOG and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Reliability was measured by internal consistency (Cronbach's α). Patients with epilepsy (n=144), neurological diseases (n=81), dementia (n=44), and controls (n=260) completed the NUCOG and the MMSE. Overall, both NUCOG and MMSE scores differed significantly across the four groups with the highest scores in the control group and the lowest in the dementia group (p<0.0001). The NUCOG scores could differentiate between patients with certain seizure types, stroke and transient ischemic attack. Compared to the MMSE, the NUCOG exhibited a higher area under the ROC curve. The convergent validity was substantially correlated, and internal consistency was very high (0.922). The Chinese version of NUCOG was demonstrated to be a sensitive and reliable screening tool for cognitive impairment in a Chinese-speaking population not only in China, but also in countries where there is a sizeable population of ethnic Chinese. Additionally, our study also showed the NUCOG could better differentiate cognitive function in patients with certain seizure types, stroke and transient ischemic attack than the MMSE. This potentially expands the clinical usefulness of NUCOG, enabling clinicians to measure the cognitive profile of patients with epilepsy and ischemic cerebrovascular diseases.", "labels": [[552, 555, "N"], [583, 585, "N"], [600, 602, "N"], [621, 624, "N"], [526, 596, "Patient"], [124, 165, "Patient"], [33, 112, "Intervention"], [180, 196, "Control"], [409, 414, "Intervention"], [609, 616, "Control"], [636, 645, "Intervention"], [769, 786, "Control"], [1135, 1163, "Intervention"], [1418, 1427, "Intervention"], [1618, 1623, "Intervention"], [650, 658, "Control"], [836, 845, "Intervention"], [968, 976, "Control"], [978, 987, "Intervention"], [1556, 1564, "Control"], [956, 1031, "Outcome"], [1033, 1133, "Outcome_2nd"], [419, 459, "Control"], [674, 679, "Intervention"], [684, 688, "Control"], [836, 954, "Outcome"], [669, 834, "Outcome"]]}

Eligible patients from two randomized controlled trials (Phase II OV-1002 and Phase III OV-1012) were able to enroll in open-label extension (OLE) study OV-1004 beginning in December 2005 and received clobazam until they discontinued (mandatory at 2 years for patients outside the United States) or until study completion in March 2012. Patients in the United States could have received clobazam for 6 years before it became commercially available. Efficacy assessments included changes in rates of drop seizures and total seizures, responder rates (≥50%, ≥75%, or 100% decreases in seizure frequency vs. baseline), sustained efficacy over time, concomitant antiepileptic drug (AED) use, and global evaluations. Safety assessments included exposure to clobazam, laboratory assessments, physical and neurologic examinations, vital sign monitoring, electrocardiography monitoring, and adverse event reporting. Of 267 patients who enrolled in the OLE, 188 (70%) completed the trial. Two hundred seven patients were from the United States, which was the only country in which patients could be treated with clobazam for >2 years. Forty-four patients were treated with clobazam for 5 years, and 11 for 6 years. Because of the low number of Year 6 patients, this group is not reported separately. Improvements in baseline seizure rates were very stable over the course of the study, with a median 85% decrease in drop seizures at Year 1, 87% at Year 2, 92% at Year 3, 97% at Year 4, and a 91% decrease for patients who had reached Year 5. Similar results were observed for total seizures (79% decrease at both Years 1 and 2, 82% decrease at Year 3, 75% decrease at Year 4, and 85% decrease at Year 5). Responder rates were also stable for the duration of the trial. Of patients who had achieved a ≥50% decrease in median drop-seizure frequency from baseline to Month 3, 86% still had that degree of drop-seizure reduction at Year 3 (and 14% lost their initial responses), and 47% were drop-seizure-free. Most patients who had achieved drop-seizure freedom in the original controlled trials remained drop-seizure-free in the OLE. Based on parents' and physicians' ratings of global evaluations, 80% of patients were very much improved or much improved after 3 years. Of the 43 patients with concomitant AED data who were treated for 5 years, 30% increased, 19% decreased, and 51% had no change in numbers of AEDs versus their Week 4 regimens. The mean modal clobazam dosage was 0.90 mg/kg/day at Year 1 and 0.97 mg/kg/day at Year 5, suggesting that study patients did not need significant increases in dosage over time. The safety profile was what would be expected for clobazam for LGS patients over a 5-year span, and no new safety concerns developed over time. In this largest and longest-running trial in LGS, adjunctive clobazam sustained seizure freedom and substantial seizure improvements at stable dosages through 3 years of therapy in this difficult- to-treat patient population.

{"id": 2107, "text": "The aim was to develop a method for the purpose of localizing epilepsy related hemodynamic foci for patients suffering intractable focal epilepsy using task-free fMRI alone. We studied three groups of subjects: patients with intractable focal epilepsy, healthy volunteers performing motor tasks, and healthy volunteers in resting state. We performed spatial independent component analysis (ICA) on the fMRI alone data and developed a set of IC selection criteria to identify epilepsy related ICs. The method was then tested in the two healthy groups. In seven out of the nine surgery patients, identified ICs were concordant with surgical resection. Our results were also consistent with presurgical evaluation of the remaining one patient without surgery and may explain why she was not suitable for resection treatment. In the motor task study of ten healthy subjects, our method revealed components with concordant spatial and temporal features as expected from the unilateral motor tasks. In the resting state study of seven healthy subjects, the method successfully rejected all components in four out of seven subjects as non-epilepsy related components. These results suggest the lateralization and localization value of fMRI alone in presurgical evaluation for patients with intractable unilateral focal epilepsy. The proposed method is noninvasive in nature and easy to implement.

Interictal electroencephalography (EEG) displays 3-6 Hz spike/polyspike and wave pattern. Photosensitivity is common. Our aim was to explore the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response evoked by a highly provocative photic stimulus in a cohort of people with JME compared to a group of nonphotosensitive healthy controls, and to investigate the hemodynamic phenomena seen in patients with photosensitive JME. We studied 13 JME patients and 18 healthy controls using EEG-functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) performed during low luminance intermittent photic stimulation (IPS). The BOLD response to IPS was investigated both in JME and control groups. In photosensitive JME subjects, we also performed a dynamic evaluation of BOLD signal changes evoked by the photoparoxysmal response (PPR) in a time frame ranging from 10 s before the onset of the EEG paroxysm up until 10 s afterward. The IPS evoked a positive BOLD response in striate and extrastriate visual areas, which was less in JME patients than in controls. Moreover, people with JME had a reduced positive BOLD response in the frontoparietal areas and putamen but a stronger negative BOLD response in the primary sensorimotor cortex (SM1) and in cortical regions belonging to the default mode network (DMN). In JME, the dynamic evaluation of BOLD signal changes related to PPR revealed an early positive response in the putamen and SM1, followed by BOLD signal decrements in the putamen, caudate nuclei, thalami, and SM1. Our results confirm the hypothesis that people with JME might have an altered interaction between the motor circuit and other neuronal networks, with prominent involvement of basal ganglia circuitry.

The study included a 6-week baseline phase, 4-week dose-escalation phase, and 12-week maintenance phase. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with a ≥ 50% reduction in 28-day seizure rate during the 12-week maintenance phase, as compared with baseline. Noninferiority of pregabalin was declared if the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the difference in responder rates was greater than the prespecified noninferiority margin of -12%. A key secondary endpoint was the percent change from baseline in 28-day seizure rate during the dose-escalation and maintenance phases. Five hundred nine patients were randomized to pregabalin (n = 254) or levetiracetam (n = 255) and 418 (208 pregabalin, 210 levetiracetam) completed the maintenance phase.

{"id": 2119, "text": "Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is an important indicator of well-being in patients with epilepsy. When assessing changes in HRQOL over time, some of the changes observed may be due to the patients' change in the internal standards, value, or meaning that they attribute to the HRQOL domain being measured, rather than actual change, a phenomenon known as response shift. Response shifts are increasingly recognized as an important explanation for the seemingly paradoxical or counterintuitive HRQOL results often observed in chronic conditions. We investigated the presence of changing values (reprioritization response shift) in data from a surgical randomized controlled trial of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Eighty patients with TLE, who were randomized to surgical and medical treatment, provided data on the epilepsy-specific 31-item Quality of life in Epilepsy (QOLIE-31) questionnaire at baseline and 1 year after randomization. Reprioritization response shift among the seven QOLIE-31 domains was assessed using changes in the relative importance weights derived from logistic regression and discriminant analysis. The relative importance analysis showed a statistically significant increase over time in the importance of social function, but a significant decrease in the relative importance of seizure worry. There were no significant changes in the relative importance of the remaining five domains in distinguishing between surgical and medical group over time. Patients that receive surgical treatment are more likely to experience a decrease in the valuation of seizure worry and an increase in the value of social function as compared to patients who are medically treated. Changes in expectation about seizure freedom and social function may confound the assessment of longitudinal change on these outcomes, and highlight the importance of assessing response shift and the limitations of assessing HRQOL at a single point in time or without a control group.

The decline in T2R values at six months was more prominent in the treatment group. T2R values at baseline and at three months differed significantly depending on the stage of the lesion, being higher in stage 2 SCCL. T2R values from SCCL declined over 24 months, being significantly higher in earlier stages of degeneration. A mild increase after six months may be due to the initiation of gliosis.

Forty-one children with intractable epilepsy were included in a randomized, active-controlled, double-blind study.

{"id": 2124, "text": "The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of medication education and behavioral intervention on Chinese patients with epilepsy and to compare the difference between them. A total of 109 patients with epilepsy who did not to take their antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) more than once were randomly assigned to two intervention groups: the medication education group (group I) and the medication education with behavioral intervention group (group II). Group I was initially provided with medication education in the form of oral education and written materials, and this education was reinforced by monthly calls from the pharmacist over the next six months. The behavioral intervention provided to group II consisted of a modified medication schedule which was based on cue-dose training therapy. The outcomes that were evaluated both in the beginning and in the end of the study included adherence, which was measured using the four-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS-4), the number of seizures, knowledge of AEDs, and the number of patients who missed a dose of their AEDs. Differences within and between the groups were analyzed. After intervention, the adherence and knowledge of AEDs increased greatly in all patients, and the number of patients who had seizures or missed AEDs decreased. However, no significant differences were observed between groups I and II. The observed changes were (group I vs group II, p value) increased adherence: 62.3% vs 64.3%, 0.827; increased knowledge of AEDs: 88.7% vs 80.4%, 0.231; and improved seizure control: 64.2% vs 64.3%, 0.988. In addition, the percentage of patients who forgot to take their AEDs decreased to 45.0% from more than 70%, and 44.9% of these patients took the missed AEDs as soon as they remembered. These findings clearly demonstrate that medication education and reinforced telephone calls from pharmacists can help to increase adherence to AEDs, the knowledge of patients regarding AEDs, and seizure control. However, the inclusion of a behavioral strategy that was easy to administer and use in this program did not lead to any significant effects on improving adherence.

Patients continued their randomized treatment, with dosing adjusted according to tolerability/response (zonisamide 200-500 mg/day; carbamazepine 400-1,200 mg/day). Safety assessments included treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and clinical laboratory parameters. Efficacy assessments included retention rate and the proportion of patients remaining seizure free for ≥24 months. Overall, 120 (87.6%) of 137 patients randomized to zonisamide and 134 (84.8%) of 158 patients randomized to carbamazepine completed the study. More than three-fourths of patients were exposed to >24 months of treatment.

Randomised placebo-controlled trial of low-dose and high-dose fish oil versus placebo (corn oil, linoleic acid) in 24 participants with drug resistant epilepsy. A three-period crossover design was utilised lasting 42 weeks, with three 10-week treatment periods and two 6-week washout periods. All participants were randomised in double-blind fashion to receive placebo, high dose or low dose in different sequences. The primary outcome was per cent change in total seizure frequency. Low-dose fish oil (3 capsules/day, 1080 mg eicosapentaenoic acid+docosahexaenoic acid) was associated with a 33.6% reduction in seizure frequency compared with placebo. Low-dose fish oil was also associated with a mild but significant reduction in blood pressure. High-dose fish oil was no different than placebo in reducing seizures or improving cardiac risk factors. In this phase II randomised crossover trial, low-dose fish oil was effective in reducing seizures compared with placebo. The magnitude of improvement is similar to that of recent antiepileptic drug trials in drug resistant epilepsy (DRE). The results indicate that low-dose fish oil may reduce seizures and improve the health of people with epilepsy. These findings justify a large multicentre randomised trial of low-dose fish oil (n-3 fatty acids <1080 mg/day) in drug resistant epilepsy.

{"id": 2144, "text": "In patients with epilepsy, poor adherence to anti-epileptic drugs has been shown to be the most important cause of poorly controlled epilepsy. Furthermore, it has been noted that the quality of life among patients with epilepsy can be improved by counseling and treatments aimed at increasing their self-efficacy and concordance, thus stimulating self-management skills. However, there is a need for evidence on the effectiveness of such programs, especially within epilepsy care. Therefore, we have developed a multi-component intervention (MCI) which combines a self-management/education program with e-Health interventions. Accordingly, the overall objective of this study is to assess the (cost)-effectiveness and feasibility of the MCI, aiming to improve self-efficacy and concordance in patients with epilepsy. A RCT in two parallel groups will be conducted to compare the MCI with a control condition in epilepsy patients. One hundred eligible epilepsy patients will be recruited and allocated to either the intervention or control group. The intervention group will receive the MCI consisting of a self-management/education program of six meetings, including e-Health interventions, and will be followed for 12 months. The control group will receive care as usual and will be followed for 6 months, after which patients will be offered the possibility of participating in the MCI. The study will consist of three parts: 1) a clinical effectiveness study, 2) a cost-effectiveness study, and 3) process evaluation. The primary outcome will be self-efficacy. Secondary outcomes include adherence, side effects, change in seizure severity & frequency, improved quality of life, proactive coping, and societal costs. Outcome assessments will be done using questionnaires at baseline and after 3, 6, 9, and 12 months (last two applicable only for intervention group). In times of budget constraints, MCI could be a valuable addition to the current healthcare provision for epilepsy, as it is expected that higher concordance and self-efficacy will result in reduced use of healthcare resources and an increased QOL. Accordingly, this study is aimed helping patients to be their own provider of health care, shifting epilepsy management from professionals to self-care by patients equipped with appropriate skills and tools.

Outcomes were assessed for all partial-onset seizures, secondarily generalized (SG) tonic-clonic seizures only, and complex partial plus SG (CP + SG) seizures. Perampanel 4-12 mg significantly prolonged median time to prerandomization monthly seizure count, generally by more than 1 week, compared with placebo, across all 3 studies, consistent with the original primary outcomes. Analysis of SG seizures only, and CP + SG seizures, also indicated a significantly prolonged median time to prerandomization monthly seizure count with perampanel 8 mg and 12 mg compared with placebo. Time to prerandomization monthly seizure count is a promising novel alternative to the standard endpoints of median percent change in seizure frequency and 50% responder rates used in trials of add-on AEDs.

Following 6-week baseline, patients were randomized to once-daily, double-blind treatment with placebo or perampanel 8 or 12 mg (studies 304 and 305) or placebo or perampanel 2, 4, or 8 mg (study 306). Treatment response assessed by median percent reduction in seizure frequency and responder rates improved with perampanel compared with placebo.

The treatment effect (perampanel-placebo) also demonstrated a dose-dependent increase in all patients. The overall incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was similar regardless of the presence of EIAEDs. Occurrence of some adverse events, such as fatigue, somnolence, dizziness, irritability, was greater in patients receiving non-EIAEDs, as was discontinuation because of adverse events. Perampanel shows efficacy and safety in the presence and absence of EIAEDs. As systemic exposure to perampanel increases, so does efficacy. Given the extensive metabolism of perampanel, systemic exposure is clearly reduced with concomitant administration of CYP3A4 inducers. This supports the strategy of dosing perampanel to clinical effect. Recognition of these pharmacokinetic interactions will be important in the optimization of this novel medication.

The possible role of ESL as monotherapy to treat POS has not yet been established. This study was an 18-week, multicenter, randomized double-blind trial of gradual conversion to ESL monotherapy in adults with POS not well controlled by 1-2 antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), using historical data as the control. The study comprised an 8-week baseline period, a 2-week titration period, a 6-week AED conversion period, a 10-week monotherapy period, and either a 1-week taper period or optional entry to an open-label extension study. The primary endpoint compared the Kaplan-Meier (KM)-estimated 112-day exit rate with a threshold value calculated from the historical controls. There were 172 randomized patients; 154 (90%) entered the AED conversion period and 121 (70%) completed the study.

Demographics, baseline focal seizure characteristics and results of the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale at the 12-month visit were reported. The primary objective of this study was to assess the percentage of patients who achieved a 6-month terminal seizure remission at the 12-month visit following treatment with a first AED administered as monotherapy. Secondary outcome variables included the calculation of the 6-month terminal seizure remission according to the baseline seizure types and patient retention at the 12 and 18 month visits. In addition, bivariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to identify independent predictors of 6-month terminal seizure remission at the 12-month visit. The mean age of the 234 eligible patients was 31.6 years and the majority were males (62%). At baseline, the most common type of focal seizures was focal seizures with impairment of consciousness (45%), and the most frequent topographical localization was in the temporal lobe (47%). In total, 77.6% of the patients achieved a 6-month terminal seizure remission at the 12-month visit. Patients with an epileptogenic lesion on neuroimaging were significantly less likely to achieve a 6-month remission compared to those with no identifiable pathological substrate. Patients with focal motor seizures without impairment of consciousness at baseline had significantly lower odds of achieving a 6-month terminal seizure remission compared to patients with a combination of seizure types.

This post hoc analysis evaluated the occurrence and characteristics of the most common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) associated with PER. Results from the Phase III studies were pooled; post hoc analyses on the double-blind phase and up to 1 year of the OLE were performed on the four most common TEAEs for which incidence was higher for PER than PBO. The four most common TEAEs were dizziness, somnolence, fatigue, and irritability. For most subjects in the Phase III double-blind studies, these TEAEs were observed during 6-week titration and were mild or moderate in severity. For severe AEs, no dose-response relationship was observed. Patients in the PBO group during Phase III (who therefore received their first PER treatment during OLE) experienced these TEAEs with incidence and timing similar to that of PER-treated patients in Phase III. The first onset of these TEAEs occurred during the early weeks of PER conversion in the OLE. After 6months and up to 1 year of PER treatment, low to no incidence of the first onset of the four TEAEs was observed. Post hoc analyses of data from pooled Phase III studies provide greater insight into occurrence/duration of TEAEs. Phase III double-blind and OLE data showed that dizziness, somnolence, fatigue, and irritability were the most common TEAEs reported by patients taking PER. Additionally, these results suggest consistency between studies in patient responses to onset of these TEAEs.

To assess potential for delayed cardiac repolarization, a Phase I thorough QT study was performed, supplemented by plasma concentration-QT data modeled from 3 pooled Phase III studies. The Phase I thorough QT study (double-blind, combined fixed-sequence, parallel-group) quantified the effect of perampanel (6 mg once daily for 7 days, followed by dose escalation to a single 8-mg dose, a single 10-mg dose, then 12 mg once daily for 7 days), moxifloxacin positive control (single 400-mg dose on Day 16), and placebo on QT interval duration in healthy subjects (N = 261). Electrocardiograms were recorded at baseline, Day 7 (post 6 mg dose), and Day 16 (post 12 mg dose). Statistical comparisons were between the highest approved perampanel dose (12 mg) versus placebo, a mid-therapeutic dose (6 mg) versus placebo, and moxifloxacin versus placebo. Acknowledging that the Phase I thorough QT study could not incorporate a true supratherapeutic dose due to length of titration and tolerability concerns in healthy subjects, Phase III studies of perampanel included expanded electrocardiogram safety evaluations specifically intended to support concentration-QT response modeling. The lack of effect of perampanel on the QT interval is shown from pooled analysis of 3 double-blind, placebo-controlled, 19-week, Phase III studies with perampanel doses ≤ 12 mg (N = 1038, total perampanel; and N=442, placebo) in patients with partial seizures. QT measures were corrected for heart rate using Fridericia's (QTcF; the primary endpoint) and Bazett's (QTcB) formulas. In the Phase I thorough QT study, the positive control moxifloxacin caused peak time-matched, baseline-adjusted, placebo-corrected (ΔΔ) QTcF of 12.15 ms at 4h postdose, confirming a drug effect on QTc interval and study assessment sensitivity. Mean baseline-adjusted (Δ) QTcF versus nominal time curves were comparable between perampanel 12 mg and placebo, with most ΔQTcF values being slightly negative. Healthy subjects receiving perampanel 6 and 12 mg doses for 7 days showed no evidence of effects on cardiac repolarization.

At every time point, the upper 95% confidence limit of ΔΔQTcF for perampanel 6 and 12 mg was <10 ms. Phase III studies revealed no clinically significant difference between patients with partial seizures treated with perampanel or placebo in QTcF and QTcB values >450 ms, with no dose-dependent increases or large incremental changes from baseline of >60 ms. Regression analysis of individual plasma perampanel concentrations versus corresponding QTc interval values in Phase I thorough QT and Phase III studies demonstrated no relationship between perampanel concentrations and QT interval duration.

We have previously demonstrated that burst stimulation of the fornix is able to significantly improve memory in a rodent model of traumatic brain injury. The present study is a preliminary investigation with a small group of cases to explore whether theta burst stimulation of the fornix might improve memory in humans. Four individuals undergoing stereo-electroencephalography evaluation for drug-resistant epilepsy were enrolled. All participants were implanted with an electrode into the proximal fornix and dorsal hippocampal commissure on the language dominant (n = 3) or language non-dominant (n = 1) side, and stimulation of this electrode reliably produced a diffuse evoked potential in the head and body of the ipsilateral hippocampus. Each participant underwent testing of verbal memory (Rey Auditory-Verbal Learning Test), visual-spatial memory (Medical College of Georgia Complex Figure Test), and visual confrontational naming (Boston Naming Test Short Form) once per day over at least two consecutive days using novel test forms each day. For 50% of the trials, the fornix electrode was continuously stimulated using a burst pattern (200 Hz in 100 ms trains, five trains per second, 100 µs, 7 mA) and was compared with sham stimulation. Participants and examiners were blinded to whether stimulation was active or not, and the order of stimulation was randomized. The small sample size precluded use of inferential statistics; therefore, data were analysed using descriptive statistics and graphic analysis. Burst stimulation of the fornix was not perceived by any of the participants but was associated with a robust reversible improvement in immediate and delayed performance on the Medical College of Georgia Complex Figure Test.

The aim of the trial is to determine prospectively if ioECoG-tailored surgery using HFOs, instead of interictal spikes, is feasible and will lead to an equal or better seizure outcome. METHODS\\ We present a single-blinded multi-center randomized controlled trial The HFO Trial including patients with refractory focal epilepsy of all ages who undergo surgery with intra-operative electrocorticography. Surgery is tailored by HFOs (arm 1) or interictal spikes (arm 2) in the intra-operative electrocorticography. Primary outcome is post-operative outcome after 1 year, dichotomized in seizure freedom (Engel 1A and 1B) versus seizure recurrence (Engel 1C-4). Secondary outcome measures are the volume of resected tissue, neurologic deficits, surgical duration and complications, cognition and quality of life. The trial has a non-inferiority design to test feasibility and at least equal performance in terms of surgical outcome. We aim to include 78 patients within 3 years including 1 year follow-up. Results are expected in 2018. This trial provides a transition from observational research towards clinical interventions using HFOs. We address methodological difficulties in designing this trial. We expect that the use of HFOs as a biomarker for tailoring will increase the success rate of epilepsy surgery while reducing resection volume. This may reduce neurological deficits and yield a better quality of life. Future technical developments, such as validated automatic online HFO identification, could, together with the attained clinical knowledge, lead to a new objective tailoring approach in epilepsy surgery.

Patients with POS (≥2 years' duration, ≥2 previous antiepileptic drugs [AEDs]) uncontrolled by a stable dosing regimen of 1-3 concomitant AEDs were randomized to treatment with lacosamide at doses of 200 mg/day, 400 mg/day, or 600 mg/day, or placebo. Studies comprised a 4- to 6-week titration phase to target dose followed by a 12-week maintenance phase. Safety outcomes included treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) of particular relevance to patients with POS, overall TEAEs, and discontinuations due to TEAEs. Post hoc analyses included evaluation of TEAEs potentially related to cognition and TEAEs leading to discontinuation analyzed by concomitant AEDs. One thousand three hundred eight patients were randomized to and received treatment; 944 to lacosamide and 364 to placebo. Most patients (84.4%) were taking 2 or 3 concomitant AEDs. The most common drug-associated TEAEs (reported by ≥5% of patients in any lacosamide dose group and with an incidence at least twice that reported for placebo during the treatment phase) were dizziness (30.6% for lacosamide vs 8.2% for placebo), nausea (11.4% vs 4.4%), and diplopia (10.5% vs 1.9%). Common drug-associated TEAEs generally appeared to be dose-related, and the incidence of each was lower during the 12-week maintenance phase than during the titration phase. Most TEAEs were either mild or moderate in intensity; severe TEAEs were predominantly observed with lacosamide 600 mg/day. No individual serious TEAE occurred in ≥1% of all lacosamide-treated patients. Treatment-emergent adverse events led to discontinuation in 8.1%, 17.2%, and 28.6% of the lacosamide 200-, 400-, and 600-mg/day groups, respectively (vs 4.9% of placebo). Few TEAEs were related to rash, weight loss/gain, changes in clinical chemistry parameters, or psychiatric disturbances, or were seizure-related. The odds of reporting any potential cognition-related TEAE vs placebo increased with dose and were similar between lacosamide doses of 200 and 400mg/day and placebo (odds ratio 1.3, 95% confidence interval 0.7-2.4).

Moreover, AED withdrawal seemed to improve cognitive outcome. A randomized trial is needed to confirm these findings. We hypothesized that early AED withdrawal in children is not only safe, but also beneficial with respect to cognitive functioning. This is a multi-center pragmatic randomized clinical trial to investigate whether early AED withdrawal improves cognitive function, in terms of attention, executive function and intelligence, quality of life and behavior, and to confirm safety in terms of eventual seizure freedom, seizure recurrences and seizure and AED freedom. Patients will be randomly allocated in parallel groups (1:1) to either early or late AED withdrawal. Randomization will be concealed and stratified for preoperative IQ and medical center. In the early withdrawal arm reduction of AEDs will start 4 months after surgery, while in the late withdrawal arm reduction starts 12 months after surgery, with intended complete cessation of drugs after 12 and 20 months respectively. Cognitive outcome measurements will be performed preoperatively, and at 1 and 2 years following surgery, and consist of assessment of attention and executive functioning using the EpiTrack Junior test and intelligence expressed as IQ (Wechsler Intelligence Scales).

Long-term efficacy and safety were evaluated with combined open and closed-loop VNS. Sixty-six seizures (n=16 patients) were available from the EMU for analysis. In 37 seizures (n=14 patients) a ≥ 20% heart rate increase was found and 11 (n=5 patients) were associated with ictal tachycardia (iTC, 55% or 35 bpm heart rate increase, minimum of 100 bpm). Multiple CBSDA settings achieved a sensitivity of ≥ 80%. False positives ranged from 0.5 to 7.2/h. 27/66 seizures were stimulated within ± 2 min of seizure onset. In 10/17 of these seizures, where triggered VNS overlapped with ongoing seizure activity, seizure activity stopped during stimulation. Physician-scored seizure severity (NHS3-scale) showed significant improvement for complex partial seizures (CPS) at EMU discharge and through 12 months (p<0.05). Patient-scored seizure severity (total SSQ score) showed significant improvement at 3 and 6 months. Quality of life (total QOLIE-31-P score) showed significant improvement at 12 months.

Post-hoc analysis of these studies was conducted to determine the efficacy and tolerability of perampanel based on the number of concomitant antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) at baseline, as well as to examine which baseline characteristics, if any, were predictors of efficacy. Efficacy parameters were based on the number of baseline AEDs, and logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate the association of demographic and baseline clinical factors with probability of ≥ 50% reduction in seizure frequency. Patients on 1 AED at baseline were significantly more likely to have reduced seizure frequency (P<0.02) and improved 50% responder rate (P<0.02) than patients on 3 AEDs at baseline. Secondarily generalized seizures at baseline, unknown etiology, and use of concomitant non-inducer AEDs were also established as positive predictors of efficacy (50% responder rate; P<0.01). Patients with more AEDs at baseline were associated with greater use of inducers (P<0.01), which may result in decreased exposure of perampanel in these patients and lower efficacy. Patients with 1 AED at baseline had a significantly shorter time since diagnosis compared with patients in the 3 (P<0.01) AEDs group, as well as a lower median seizure frequency at baseline compared to patients on 3 AEDs (P<0.05), suggesting that the reduced efficacy of perampanel with 3 AEDs may also be associated with the greater severity of seizures in the patient groups. The incidence of adverse events in perampanel-treated patients was similar regardless of the number of AEDs at baseline. Greater efficacy is predicted for patients receiving fewer concomitant AEDs when starting perampanel, as well as for those receiving concomitant treatment with AEDs that are not CYP3A4 enzyme-inducers, compared to patients treated with multiple concomitant AEDs. The results of this study provide additional information for clinicians considering adding perampanel to their patients' treatment regimen earlier rather than later, and offer evidence regarding the potential for increased efficacy with a decreased medication burden.", "labels": [[114, 158, "Patient"]]}

A population PK analysis was conducted including plasma rufinamide concentrations from Study 303 and two other study populations of LGS subjects ≥ 4 years. The rufinamide PK profile was dose independent. The apparent clearance (CL/F) estimated from the PK model was 2.19 L/h; it was found to increase significantly as a function of body weight.

The Equivalence among Generic Antiepileptic Drugs (EQUIGEN) chronic-dose study was a randomised, double-blind, crossover study that enrolled adults (aged ≥18 years) with epilepsy from six epilepsy centres at academic institutions across the USA who were receiving immediate-release lamotrigine dosed at 100 mg, 200 mg, 300 mg, or 400 mg twice daily. Eligible patients were randomly allocated (1:1) to one of two treatment sequences (sequence 1 or sequence 2), comprising four study periods of 14 days each. During each 14-day treatment period, patients received balanced doses of an oral generic lamotrigine product every 12 h (200-800 mg total, identical to lamotrigine dose prior to study enrolment); after each 14-day period, patients were crossed over to receive the other generic product. Computer-based randomisation was done using random permuted blocks of size two or four for each site to prevent sequence predictability. Both patients and study personnel were masked to the generic products selected, their predicted exposure (ie, high vs low), and their group allocation. The primary outcome of this trial was bioequivalence between the generic products, which was assessed at the end of the study through a comparison of maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) for each product in the analysis population (all patients who completed all four treatment periods). Bioequivalence was established if the 90% CIs of the ratios of these two parameters for the two products were within equivalence limits (80-125%) in the analysis population.

Ten patients were operated using the TS approach, and eight were operated via the TC approach. Vasomotor reactivity patterns measured with micro-Doppler were physiologically prior to selAH in both groups. After completion of surgery, a significant increase in SO2-values occurred in the TS group (before: 56.7 ± 2.2, after: 65.5 ± 3.0%SO2), but not in the TC group (before: 52.9 ± 5.2, after: 53.0 ± 3.7%SO2).

Our findings provide the first invasively measured evidence that patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy have preserved cerebral blood flow responses to alterations in CO2. In addition, local cortical SO2 was higher in the TS group than in the TC group after selAH.

After standardizing for demographic differences, children with CAE were more likely to be overweight (19.3% vs 13.8%; p < 0.001) or obese (14.5% vs 11.5%; p < 0.001) than NHANES controls. The combined prevalence of overweight and obesity was 33.8% in the CAE cohort and 25.3% among controls (p < 0.001). Mean daily energy intake (difference -79.5 kcal/day, p = 0.04) and daily carbohydrate intake (difference -10.7 g/day, p = 0.04) were lower in the CAE group than in NHANES controls. With increasing baseline BMI z score, the efficacy and effectiveness of ethosuximide and valproic acid over lamotrigine became more pronounced, despite no significant differences in drug exposure and trough levels. Overweight and obesity are more prevalent in children with newly diagnosed CAE than in age-matched peers, despite lower caloric and carbohydrate intake. Baseline BMI may also predict differential drug response, which cannot be attributed to pharmacokinetic differences.", "labels": [[349, 352, "N"], [592, 684, "Control"], [128, 186, "Patient"]]}

Transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS) is a non-invasive technique to stimulate the left auricular branch of the vagus nerve at the ear conch. We performed a randomized, double-blind controlled trial (cMPsE02) to assess efficacy and safety of tVNS vs. control stimulation in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. Primary objective was to demonstrate superiority of add-on therapy with tVNS (stimulation frequency 25 Hz, n = 39) versus active control (1 Hz, n = 37) in reducing seizure frequency over 20 weeks. Secondary objectives comprised reduction in seizure frequency from baseline to end of treatment, subgroup analyses and safety evaluation. Treatment adherence was 84% in the 1 Hz group and 88% in the 25 Hz group, respectively. Stimulation intensity significantly differed between the 1 Hz group (1.02 ± 0.83 mA) and the 25 Hz group (0.50 ± 0.47 mA; p = 0.006). Mean seizure reduction per 28 days at end of treatment was -2.9% in the 1 Hz group and 23.4% in the 25 Hz group (p = 0.146). In contrast to controls, we found a significant reduction in seizure frequency in patients of the 25 Hz group who completed the full treatment period (20 weeks; n = 26, 34.2%, p = 0.034). Responder rates (25%, 50%) were similar in both groups. Subgroup analyses for seizure type and baseline seizure frequency revealed no significant differences. Adverse events were usually mild or moderate and comprised headache, ear pain, application site erythema, vertigo, fatigue, and nausea. Four serious adverse events were reported including one sudden unexplained death in epilepsy patients (SUDEP) in the 1 Hz group which was assessed as not treatment-related. tVNS had a high treatment adherence and was well tolerated. Superiority of 25 Hz tVNS over 1 Hz tVNS could not be proven in this relatively small study, which might be attributed to the higher stimulation intensity in the control group.

{"id": 2228, "text": "The advantages and disadvantages of using epileptic as a noun to describe someone with epilepsy have long been debated. Recent high-profile recommendations have stated that the term should not be used, including in English, as it perpetuates stigma. This decision was largely informed by a Brazilian Global Campaign Against Epilepsy study that reported experimental evidence indicating that, with students, the label evokes more negative attitudes than person with epilepsy. The generalizability of this effect to different countries/cultures, and thus the justification for the recommendations, has never been tested. We replicated the Brazilian study in the UK, in English, while also addressing methodological limitations. It was powered to detect the effects reported by the Brazilian study, with 234 students completing a survey regarding epilepsy attitudes. Half were randomized to Group 1 and half to Group 2. In Group 1, patients were referred to as people/person with epilepsy within the attitudinal measures, while in Group 2 they were referred to as epileptic/s. Measures included translations of the questions used in the Brazilian study and the Attitudes and Beliefs about Living with Epilepsy scale. Participants' epilepsy familiarity and knowledge were also assessed. The two groups were comparable in characteristics. A comparison of their responses to the attitude measures revealed no statistically significant or meaningful differences. In this English replication, the word epileptic did not provoke more negative attitudes. This suggests that the effect reported by the Brazilian study might be culturally dependent. Methodological limitations to that study might also be relevant. Our results have implications for the global debate about how negative attitudes towards epilepsy might be addressed. Simply not saying epileptic may not promote the positive attitudes towards epilepsy that had been expected.

{"id": 2229, "text": "Parents of children with epilepsy and other neurological conditions live with a feeling of constant uncertainty. The uncertainty associated with caring for a child with a neurological condition produces stress, which leads to decreased parental belief in caregiving skills, anxiety, and depression, ultimately altering parental functioning resulting in an increase in child behavioral problems. The stress associated with caring for children with neurological conditions is unlike caring for children with other chronic conditions. Neurological conditions are unpredictable, and there are often no warning signs before an acute event. This unpredictability accompanied with stigma results in social isolation and impacts family functioning. In addition, children with neurological conditions have a higher rate of psychological comorbidities and behavior problems when compared with children with other chronic conditions. This produces an additional burden on the parents and family. This randomized controlled trial tested the efficacy of the Creating Opportunities for Parent Empowerment intervention for parents of children with epilepsy and other neurological conditions. This intervention was administered at three intervals: (a) during hospital admission, (b) 3 days after hospital discharge by telephone, and (c) 4-6 weeks after hospital discharge. Forty-six parents of children admitted to the inpatient neuroscience unit at Boston Children's Hospital participated in the study. Several study limitations resulted in an inadequate sample size to obtain the power necessary to reach statistically significant results for most of the research questions. A one-between, one-within multivariate analysis of variance revealed that the main effect of time was significant for differences in state anxiety for both the usual care group and the intervention group, F(1, 20) = 9.86, p = .005, indicating that state anxiety for both groups combined was more pronounced during the hospitalization. A one-between, one-within multivariate analysis of variance showed that the effect of the interaction between time and group was significant for internalized behavior assessment system score only (p = .037) because the usual care group reported a significant decrease in internalizing behavior scores in their children over time. Findings from this study have significant implications for clinical practice and future research. Parents of children with neurological conditions often struggle to manage a constant feeling of uncertainty in their daily lives. Nurses possess the knowledge and expertise necessary to identify the psychosocial needs of these parents and provide education and support as needed.

A population pharmacokinetic (PK) model and a population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PKPD) model were developed describing brivaracetam plasma concentration and the relationship with daily seizure counts in adequate well-controlled efficacy trials. The effect of body weight on clearance and volume was implemented using allometric scaling, and a range of covariates were investigated for their influence on brivaracetam clearance. The PKPD model described daily seizure counts using a negative binomial distribution, taking previous day seizures into account, and using a mixture model to separate placebo-like and response subpopulations. The PK and PKPD models provided a good description of the data, documented using visual predictive checks. Coadministration with carbamazepine, phenytoin, and phenobarbital decreased brivaracetam exposure by 26%, 21%, and 19%, respectively, without significant effects on PD response. Covariate analysis indicated that levetiracetam coadministration reduced the fraction of subjects in the mixture model response population to 4% and identified baseline seizure frequency as a strong predictor for being assigned to the mixture model response population.

{"id": 2238, "text": "In adults with intellectual disability (ID) and epilepsy there are suggestions that improvements in management may follow introduction of epilepsy nurse-led care. However, this has not been tested in a definitive clinical trial and results cannot be generalised from general population studies as epilepsy tends to be more severe and to involve additional clinical comorbidities in adults with ID. This trial investigates whether nurses with expertise in epilepsy and ID, working proactively to a clinically defined role, can improve clinical and quality of life outcomes in the management of epilepsy within this population, compared to treatment as usual. The trial also aims to establish whether any perceived benefits represent good value for money. The EpAID clinical trial is a two-arm cluster randomised controlled trial of nurse-led epilepsy management versus treatment as usual. This trial aims to obtain follow-up data from 320 participants with ID and drug-resistant epilepsy. Participants are randomly assigned either to a 'treatment as usual' control or a 'defined epilepsy nurse role' active arm, according to the cluster site at which they are treated. The active intervention utilises the recently developed Learning Disability Epilepsy Specialist Nurse Competency Framework for adults with ID. Participants undergo 4 weeks of baseline data collection, followed by a minimum of 20 weeks intervention (novel treatment or treatment as usual), followed by 4 weeks of follow-up data collection. The primary outcome is seizure severity, including associated injuries and the level of distress manifest by the patient in the preceding 4 weeks. Secondary outcomes include cost-utility analysis, carer strain, seizure frequency and side effects. Descriptive measures include demographic and clinical descriptors of participants and clinical services in which they receive their epilepsy management. Qualitative study of clinical interactions and semi-structured interviews with clinicians and participants' carers are also undertaken. The EpAID clinical trial is the first cluster randomised controlled trial to test possible benefits of a nurse-led intervention in adults with epilepsy and ID. This research will have important implications for ID and epilepsy services. The challenges of undertaking such a trial in this population, and the approaches to meeting these are discussed.

Our study investigated the impact of a technical monitoring system on subjective quality of sleep and the lives of affected families. Furthermore, we evaluated the impact of anxiety levels on seizure monitoring and vice versa. Forty-three patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy were included. Initially, the families decided whether they did (group 1, n=27) or did not (group 2, n=16) want to use a monitoring device. In group 1, patients were randomly assigned to using Epi-Care® (group 1A, n=14) or an audio baby monitor (group 1B, n=13). Quality of life was assessed at two points (t1, at the start of the study and t2, at 5-7months of follow-up) using the SF-12, Kindl-R, and Familien-Belastungs-Fragebogen (German version of the Impact on Family Scale). In addition, parental anxiety was measured using the State-Trait Anxiety-Inventory, and subjective quality of sleep was measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Statistical analysis focused on the possible differences between groups 1 and 2 that may influence parents' decisions and the effects of the presence and types of technical monitoring over time. Anxiety levels were not significantly different between the groups with and without monitoring (group 1 vs. group 2). We also found no statistically significant, substantial baseline differences between the Epi-Care® and audio baby monitor groups, with at least medium effect sizes (group 1A vs. group 1B). Parents' health-related mental quality of life measured via the SF-12 increased significantly over time in all groups. By tendency, the fear of further seizures as well as the frequency of cosleeping arrangements in the monitoring group decreased during the study and approached the stable values of the control group. Individual parental anxiety levels are not crucial in the decision regarding the use of a monitoring device. A monitoring system may help some families in certain aspects of daily life.

The physician chose VPA or CBZ as preferred standard treatment; patients were randomized to standard AEDs or LEV. The primary endpoint was time to treatment withdrawal. Results are exploratory, since KOMET was not powered for a subgroup analysis by age. Patients (n = 308) were randomized to LEV (n = 48) or VPA-ER (n = 53) in the VPE-ER stratum or to LEV (n = 104) or CBZ-CR (n = 103) in the CBZ-CR stratum. Mean age was 69.6 years, range 60.2-89.9 years (intention-to-treat population n = 307).

The patients were notified of the follow-ups. We compared this protocol to subsequently acquired early comprehensive patient care (ECPC), which included a consultation by an epileptologist in the emergency department (ED), a routine or long-term monitoring electroencephalogram (LTM-EEG), magnetic resonance imaging and three follow-up consultations (3 weeks, 3 months, 12 months). 183 patients were included (113 ECPC, 70 SPC).

Brivaracetam (BRV), a selective, high-affinity ligand for synaptic vesicle 2A (SV2A), has been shown to be useful for the adjunctive treatment of focal seizures. We sought to determine its specific efficacy in treating SGTCS. Data were pooled from three Phase III studies (NCT00490035; NCT00464269; NCT01261325) of adults with focal seizures taking 1-2 antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) who received placebo or BRV 50-200mg/day without titration over a 12-week treatment period. We report efficacy and safety/tolerability data for the BRV therapeutic dose range (50-200 mg/day) in patients with focal seizures including baseline SGTCS. Patients (efficacy population, N=409) had been diagnosed with epilepsy for a mean±standard deviation duration of 22.2±13.1years. Baseline median SGTCS frequency was 3.0 per 28days. The majority (293, 71.6%) had failed ≥2 AEDs prior to study enrollment. The median percent reduction from baseline in SGTCS frequency/28days was: placebo, 33.3%; BRV 50mg/day, 66.6% (p<0.001); BRV 100mg/day, 61.2% (p=0.002); and BRV 200mg/day, 82.1% (p<0.001).

The TIME intervention was developed with input from a community advisory board and then tested for feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy in people with E-MI, using a 16-week prospective, randomized controlled design comparing TIME (N=22) vs. treatment as usual (TAU, N=22). Primary outcome was change in depressive symptoms, assessed by the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Secondary assessments included global psychiatric symptom severity, seizure frequency, sleep patterns, quality of life, stigma, social support, and self-efficacy.

MATERIAL AND METHODS We administered VPA (102) and LTG (102) to 204 children with epilepsy. Blood samples were collected before the morning dose. Serum concentration of LTG was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Serum VPA concentration was tested by fluorescence polarization immunoassay. UGT2B7 A268G, C802T, and G211T polymorphisms, as well as UGT1A4 L48V polymorphism, were assayed by direct automated DNA sequencing after PCR. Evaluation of efficacy was conducted using the Engel method. RESULTS The adjusted serum concentration of VPA was 4.26 μg/mL per mg/kg and LTG was 1.56 μg/mL per mg/kg. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that VPA or LTG adjusted concentration showed a good linear relation with sex and age. UGT2B7 A268G and C802T polymorphisms were demonstrated to affect the serum concentration of VPA (F=3.147, P=0.047; F=22.754, P=0.000). UGT1A4 L48V polymorphism was not related with the serum concentration of LTG (F=5.328, P=0.006). In the efficacy analysis, we found that C802T polymorphism exerted strong effects on efficacy of VPA (χ²=9.265, P=0.010).

{"id": 2253, "text": "Infantile spasms constitutes a severe infantile epilepsy syndrome that is difficult to treat and has a high morbidity. Hormonal therapies or vigabatrin are the most commonly used treatments. We aimed to assess whether combining the treatments would be more effective than hormonal therapy alone. In this multicentre, open-label randomised trial, 102 hospitals (Australia [three], Germany [11], New Zealand [two], Switzerland [three], and the UK [83]) enrolled infants who had a clinical diagnosis of infantile spasms and a hypsarrhythmic (or similar) EEG no more than 7 days before enrolment. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) by a secure website to receive hormonal therapy with vigabatrin or hormonal therapy alone. If parents consented, there was an additional randomisation (1:1) of type of hormonal therapy used (prednisolone or tetracosactide depot). Block randomisation was stratified for hormonal treatment and risk of developmental impairment. Parents and clinicians were not masked to therapy, but investigators assessing electro-clinical outcome were masked to treatment allocation. Minimum doses were prednisolone 10 mg four times a day or intramuscular tetracosactide depot 0·5 mg (40 IU) on alternate days with or without vigabatrin 100 mg/kg per day. The primary outcome was cessation of spasms, which was defined as no witnessed spasms on and between day 14 and day 42 from trial entry, as recorded by parents and carers in a seizure diary. Analysis was by intention to treat. The trial is registered with The International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN), number 54363174, and the European Union Drug Regulating Authorities Clinical Trials (EUDRACT), number 2006-000788-27. Between March 7, 2007, and May 22, 2014, 766 infants were screened and, of those, 377 were randomly assigned to hormonal therapy with vigabatrin (186) or hormonal therapy alone (191). All 377 infants were assessed for the primary outcome. Between days 14 and 42 inclusive no spasms were witnessed in 133 (72%) of 186 patients on hormonal therapy with vigabatrin compared with 108 (57%) of 191 patients on hormonal therapy alone (difference 15·0%, 95% CI 5·1-24·9, p=0·002). Serious adverse reactions necessitating hospitalisation occurred in 33 infants (16 on hormonal therapy alone and 17 on hormonal therapy with vigabatrin). The most common serious adverse reaction was infection occurring in five infants on hormonal therapy alone and four on hormonal therapy with vigabatrin. There were no deaths attributable to treatment. Hormonal therapy with vigabatrin is significantly more effective at stopping infantile spasms than hormonal therapy alone. The 4 week period of spasm cessation required to achieve a primary clinical response to treatment suggests that the effect seen might be sustained, but this needs to be confirmed at the 18 month follow-up.

{"id": 2255, "text": "Although generalized convulsive status epilepticus (GCSE) is a life-threatening emergency, evidence-based data to guide initial drug treatment choices are lacking in the Chinese population. We conducted this prospective, randomized, controlled trial to evaluate the relative efficacy and safety of intravenous phenobarbital and valproate in patients with GCSE. After the failure of first-line diazepam treatment, Chinese adult patients with GCSE were randomized to receive either intravenous phenobarbital (standard doses, low rate) or valproate (standard). Successful treatment was considered when clinical and electroencephalographic seizure activity ceased. Adverse events following treatment, as well as the neurological outcomes at discharge and 3 months later, were also evaluated. Overall, 73 cases were enrolled in the study. Intravenous phenobarbital was successful in 81.1% of patients, and intravenous valproate was successful in 44.4% of patients (p < 0.05). The relapse rate of status epilepticus within 24 h of receiving phenobarbital (6.7%) was significantly lower than that in patients receiving valproate (31.3%), and the total number of adverse events did not differ significantly between the two groups (p > 0.05). In the phenobarbital group, two patients (5.4%) required ventilation and two patients (5.4%) developed serious hypotension. The neurological outcomes of the phenobarbital group were generally better than those of the valproate group; however, no significant differences were observed between phenobarbital and valproate with respect to mortality (8.1 vs. 16.6%) at discharge, or mortality (16.2 vs. 30.5%) and post-symptomatic epilepsy (26.3 vs. 42.8%) at 3-month follow-up. Intravenous phenobarbital appears to be more effective than intravenous valproate for Chinese adult patients with GCSE. The occurrence of serious respiratory depression and hypotension caused by phenobarbital was reduced by decreasing the intravenous infusion rate; however, even at a lower infusion rate than typically used in other institutions, intravenous phenobarbital resulted in more serious adverse events than intravenous valproate.

Patients, investigators, and trial personnel were masked to treatment allocation. From starting doses of 100 mg/day lacosamide or 200 mg/day carbamazepine-CR, uptitration to the first target level of 200 mg/day and 400 mg/day, respectively, took place over 2 weeks. After a 1-week stabilisation period, patients entered a 6-month assessment period. If a seizure occurred, the dose was titrated to the next target level (400 or 600 mg/day for lacosamide and 800 or 1200 mg/day for carbamazepine-CR) over 2 weeks with a 1-week stabilisation period, and the 6-month assessment period began again. Patients who completed 6 months of treatment and remained seizure-free entered a 6-month maintenance period on the same dose. The primary efficacy outcome was the proportion of patients remaining free from seizures for 6 consecutive months after stabilisation at the last assessed dose. The predefined non-inferiority criteria were -12% absolute and -20% relative difference between treatment groups. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01243177.

In the full analysis set, 327 (74%) patients in the lacosamide group and 308 (70%) in the carbamazepine-CR group completed 6 months of treatment without seizures. The proportion of patients in the full analysis set predicted by the Kaplan-Meier method to be seizure-free at 6 months was 90% taking lacosamide and 91% taking carbamazepine-CR (absolute treatment-difference: -1·3%, 95% CI -5·5 to 2·8 relative treatment difference: -6·0%).

Exclusion criteria were previous genetic testing, severe intellectual disability and benign focal epilepsies of childhood. 5/40 (12.5%) patients had a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant, detected in SCN1A, DEPDC5, PCDH19, GABRG2 or NPRL2. Identifying a pathogenic SCN1A variant in a patient with drug-resistant epilepsy prompted to halt presurgical investigations due to concern of unfavorable post-surgical outcome. It also led in the same patient to discontinue long-standing carbamazepine therapy (a potentially aggravating drug in epilepsies due to SCN1A mutations), resulting in complete seizure control. Patients with pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants had a younger median age of seizure onset (range) compared to those without [18 months (8 months-18 years) vs 18 years (18 months-70 years), p=0.02].

Structural time-to-event models for dropouts (not because of a lack of efficacy) and seizures were developed using data from 883 adult patients newly diagnosed with epilepsy and experiencing focal or generalized tonic-clonic seizures, participating in a trial (SP0993; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01243177) comparing the efficacy of lacosamide and carbamazepine controlled-release monotherapy. Lacosamide dropout and seizure models were used for simulating the effect of changing the initial target dose on seizure freedom. Repeated time-to-seizure data were described by a Weibull distribution with parameters estimated separately for the first and subsequent seizures. Daily area under the plasma concentration-time curve was related linearly to the log-hazard. Disease severity, expressed as the number of seizures during the 3 months before the trial (baseline), was a strong predictor of seizure probability: patients with 7-50 seizures at baseline had a 2.6-fold (90% confidence interval 2.01-3.31) higher risk of seizures compared with the reference two to six seizures. Simulations suggested that a 400-mg/day, rather than a 200-mg/day initial target dose for patients with seven or more seizures at baseline could potentially result in an additional 8% of seizure-free patients for 6 months at the last evaluated dose level. Patients receiving lacosamide had a slightly lower dropout risk compared with those receiving carbamazepine. Baseline disease severity was the most important predictor of seizure probability. Simulations suggest that an initial target dose >200 mg/day could potentially benefit patients with greater disease severity.", "labels": [[279, 282, "N"], [283, 387, "Patient"]]}

We prospectively evaluated the long-term impact of VPA monotherapy compared with lamotrigine (LTG) monotherapy on anthropometric and metabolic parameters in women with epilepsy. Our primary objective is to understand the underlying mechanism responsible for VPA-induced obesity. Sixty-six female patients with newly diagnosed or untreated epilepsy were included in the study. Thirty-four patients with VPA and thirty-two patients with LTG were treated for a period of one year in our center. Anthropometric and clinical data were collected at 5 time points: before, at 6th week, 3rd month, 6th month, 9th month and 12th month (last visit). Biochemical and hormonal data were collected 2 time points: before and last visit. Subjects in the VPA group had significantly higher body weight than LTG-treated subjects (64.88±3.25 vs. 58.28±2.43, P<0.001). HOMA-IR level was significantly increased (2.76 vs. 1.35, P<0.05), and adiponectin levels were significantly lower in the VPA group (3.46 vs. 6.22, P<0.05). Triglycerides levels were significantly increased (118 vs. 96, P<0.05), and HDL-C levels were significantly lower in the VPA group. Both the VPA-treated group and the LTG-treated group showed no significant difference in term of total cholesterol, LDL-C, fasting blood glucose and serum leptin levels. Based on the findings of this study, we proposed that VPA induced hypoadiponectinemia which correlates significantly with insulin resistance.

{"id": 2274, "text": "The incidence of epilepsy is greatest in the first 2 years of life, an age group where there is generally a poor prognosis for both seizure control and neurodevelopmental outcome. Early control of seizures can be associated with better developmental outcome but many of the epilepsies presenting in infancy are poorly responsive to antiepileptic medication. The ketogenic diet (KD) is a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet designed to mimic the effects of starvation on the body. Dietary fat is converted into ketones in the body and used as an energy source by the brain. The KD has been shown to be successful in controlling seizures in many observational studies, and in two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in older children. However, little evidence is available in the very young. An open-label RCT where eligible children (age 3 months to 2 years with epilepsy who have failed two antiepileptic drugs (AEDs)) undergo baseline assessment, including medical and seizure history. Participants then start an observation period (7 or 14 days) with documentation of seizure frequency. Randomisation will occur on day 8 or day 15 to receive the KD or a further AED; the allocated treatment will commence on day 15, with instruction and training. A second assessment (4 weeks after start of treatment) will include a clinical review and tolerability questionnaire (modified Hague Scale of Side Effects - for those allocated to the KD group). Assessments will be repeated at 8 weeks after the start of treatment including biochemical investigations, after which, according to patient response, KD (diet group) or AED (standard AED group) will then be continued or changed. Those in the AED group who have failed to achieve seizure control at the 8-week assessment will then be offered KD outside the context of the trial. Those in the KD arm who fail to achieve seizure control will be changed to standard clinical management. All patients will be followed up for 12 months from randomisation for retention, seizure outcome, quality of life and neurodevelopmental status. The slow rate of recruitment is an ongoing practical issue. There is a limitation to the number of eligible patients compared to what was predicted, mainly due to the nature of this patient group. After a substantial amendment to widen inclusion criteria and reduce the baseline period to 7 days for patients with a high seizure burden, the rate of recruitment steadily increased. A number of operational concerns regarding dietetic time were also highlighted impacting on the recruitment rate. However, the combination of a low dropout rate and the opening of further centres, the trial should successfully meet the final recruitment target.

Writing is seen as an individual act allowing for private exploration, reflection and expression of thoughts and feelings. Participants (n=20) were recruited from a United Kingdom hospital and from membership-led organizations for individuals living with seizures. Participants were asked to produce four pieces of writing: 1) about their thoughts and feelings about their condition; 2) a letter to their condition; 3) a letter to their younger self; and 4) about a personal value. All writings were analyzed thematically using a theory- and data-driven approach. Five main-themes and 22 sub-themes emerged from the data. Theme 1: 'seizure onset' demonstrated that the development of seizures and subsequent diagnosis was an important event that could change an individuals' identity. Theme 2: 'seizure symptoms' revealed participants externalized their seizures as an intrusive agent with a constant presence in their lives. Theme 3: 'treatment and outcome' reflected medication as an essential means to controlling seizures with subsequent side effects being perceived as a compromise. Theme 4: 'living with epilepsy' explored the consequences of the condition including restrictions and stigma.

In total, 102 patients were included in the study, of whom 52 were in the intervention group. Adherence rates over 6 months were 63.7% for the CAU group and 75.9% for the intervention group. Adherence, ESES, and quality of life did not differ significantly between groups. An ICER of €54 per point increase in ESES score at 6 months and €1,105 per point increase at 12-month follow-up was found. The intervention resulted in an ICER of €88 per percentage of adherence increase at 6 months. ICERs of €8,272 and €15,144 per QALY gained were found at 6- and 12-month follow-up, respectively. Although no statistically significant difference was found after baseline adjustments, cost-effectiveness estimates for MCI appear promising.

Seventy-nine WWE of childbearing age were recruited from Epilepsy Action Australia between October and November 2013 and randomized to receive the intervention (the DA) or not, and to complete a set of questionnaires pre- and post- intervention. The DA, delivered as a PDF booklet, provided balanced evidence-based information about options, risks and benefits, including probabilities; as well as steps for clarifying values and considering options within one's personal situation. Compared with the control group, the DA group had statistically significant improvements in knowledge about pregnancy and epilepsy (Cohen's d = 1.24; 95%CI = 0.77 to 1.83) and reduced decisional conflict (Cohen's d = 0.59; 95%CI = 0.21 to 0.99). Changes in decision self-efficacy, certainty of choice, patient-practitioner communication abilities and value congruence with choice were comparable between the DA and control group. Importantly, women's decisions about motherhood were not biased towards either direction, and there were no adverse effects on depression or anxiety. All women who received the DA indicated they would recommend it to other WWE. The DA has the potential to serve as a useful support tool for WWE who are considering motherhood.

The Equivalence Among Antiepileptic Drug Generic and Brand Products in People With Epilepsy (EQUIGEN) single-dose study is a crossover, prospective, sequence-randomized, replicate pharmacokinetic study conducted at 5 US academic epilepsy centers. Fifty adults (≥18 years) with epilepsy who were taking concomitant antiepileptic drugs and not currently receiving lamotrigine were enrolled between July 18, 2013, and January 19, 2015. Every participant was randomly assigned to 1 of 3 equivalent sequences, each comprising 6 study periods, during which they had blood draws before and after medication administration. Forty-nine participants were included in intention-to-treat analyses. Participants received a single 25-mg dose of immediate-release lamotrigine at the start of each period, with the branded and the 2 most disparate generic products each studied twice. Lamotrigine was selected as the antiepileptic drug of interest because of its wide use, publications indicating problems with generic switches, and complaints to the US Food and Drug Administration regarding generic products. Both participants and study personnel were blinded to the specific generic products selected. The primary outcome was bioequivalence between products. Maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) were compared, and average bioequivalence (ABE) was established if the 90% CIs of the ratios of the 2 products were within equivalence limits (80%-125%). Of the 50 randomized participants, 49 (98%) received all 3 lamotrigine products and completed at least 3 pharmacokinetic assessments and 46 (92%) completed all 6 pharmacokinetic assessments.

Implementation fidelity evaluates whether complex interventions are delivered according to protocol. Such assessments have been used for one-to-one psychological interventions; however, the science is still developing for group interventions. We developed and tested an instrument to measure implementation fidelity of a two-day self-management course for people with epilepsy, SMILE(UK). Using audio recordings, we looked at adherence and competence of course facilitators. Adherence was assessed by checklists. Competence was measured by scoring group interaction, an overall impression score and facilitator didacticism. To measure didacticism, we developed a novel way to calculate facilitator speech using computer software. Using this new instrument, implementation fidelity of SMILE(UK) was assessed on three modules of the course, for 28% of all courses delivered. Using the instrument for adherence, scores from two independent raters showed substantial agreement with weighted Kappa of 0.67 and high percent agreement of 81.2%. For didacticism, the results from both raters were highly correlated with an intraclass coefficient of 0.97 (p < 0.0001). We found that the courses were delivered with a good level of adherence (> 50% of scored items received the maximum of 2 points) and high competence. Groups were interactive (mean score: 1.9-2.0 out of 2) and the overall impression was on average assessed as good. Didacticism varied from 42% to 93% of total module time and was not associated with the other competence scores.

At 12 months following a breakthrough seizure, the overall unadjusted risk of a recurrence over the next 12 months is lower than 20%, risk 17% (95% CI 15% to 19%). However, some patient subgroups have been identified which have an annual recurrence risk significantly greater than 20% after an initial 12-month seizure-free period following a breakthrough seizure.

The interrater agreement for motor automatisms and eye involvement was good (72%-84%). Variability of semiology features between seizures even within participants was high. Clustering analyses revealed 4 patterns (involving the presence/absence of eye involvement and motor automatisms superimposed on the nearly ubiquitous pause/stare). Most participants experienced more than one seizure cluster pattern. No individual semiologic feature was individually predictive of short-term outcome. Seizure freedom was half as likely in participants with one or more seizure having the pattern of eye involvement without motor automatisms than in participants without this pattern.

Drug-resistant epilepsy is even more frequent in subjects with intellectual disability. As a result, several non-pharmacological interventions have been proposed to improve quality of life in patients with intellectual disability and drug-resistant epilepsy. A number of studies have demonstrated that music can be effective at reducing seizures and epileptiform discharges. In particular, Mozart's sonata for two pianos in D major, K448, has been shown to decrease interictal EEG discharges and recurrence of clinical seizures in patients with intellectual disability and drug-resistant epilepsy as well. The aim of this study is to investigate the influence of Mozart's music on seizure frequency in institutionalized epileptic subjects with profound/severe intellectual disability. Twelve patients (10 males and 2 females) with a mean age of 21.6 years were randomly assigned to two groups in a cross-over design; they listened to Mozart K448 once a day for six months. A statistically significant difference was observed between the listening period and both baseline and control periods. During the music period, none of the patients worsened in seizure frequency; one patient was seizure-free, five had a greater than 50% reduction in seizure frequency and the remaining showed minimal (N=2) or no difference (N=4).

However, the effect of pretreatment with oxycodone on myoclonic and withdrawal movements has not been previously investigated. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of oxycodone on the incidence and severity of etomidate-induced myoclonus and rocuronium-induced nociceptive withdrawal movements during rapid-sequence anesthesia induction. MATERIAL AND METHODS We randomly divided 120 patients into the saline group (group S) and the oxycodone group (group O) (n=60 in each group). Patients received 0.05 mg/kg oxycodone or saline intravenously 2 min before administration of 0.3 mg/kg etomidate. The occurrence and severity of myoclonus were assessed after administration of etomidate, then rocuronium was injected, followed by evaluation of withdrawal movements. RESULTS The total frequency of involuntary movements following sequential administration of etomidate and rocuronium was significantly lower in Group O than in Group S (28.3% vs. 90%, p<0.001). The total frequency and grade 3 severity of myoclonus following etomidate injection in Group O was signiﬁcantly lower than in Group S (25.0% vs. 63.3% for total frequency; 0 vs. 10 for grade 3 severity, P<0.001).

Population PK analysis was performed using nonlinear mixed-effect modeling with data from phase II/III randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of adjunctive perampanel in POS. Perampanel exposure was predicted for all subjects and adolescents. Population PK/PD analyses were performed using data from phase III studies to explore the relationship between perampanel exposure and 28-day average seizure frequency and responder probability. Pooled perampanel PK data from 1318 subjects were described by a one-compartment disposition model. In the absence of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) affecting perampanel PK, estimated perampanel apparent clearance (CL/F) was 0.668 L/h (all subjects) and 0.682 L/h (adolescent subjects). Co-administration of carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine/phenytoin reduced perampanel exposure. Gender, Asian race (excluding Japanese or Chinese), and increasing alanine aminotransferase lowered perampanel CL/F, but differences were small and not considered clinically relevant. Adolescent outcomes were similar to the total population. Based on PK/PD data from 1748 subjects, percent reduction in 28-day average seizure frequency from baseline and responder probability increased with increasing perampanel exposure; concomitant CYP3A-inducing AEDs lowered perampanel exposure but did not impact the slope for responder probability.

A single-center, inpatient, order-randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled, crossover trial of oral quinidine included 6 patients with severe autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (ADNFLE) due to KCNT1 mutation. Order was block randomized and blinded. Four-day treatment blocks were used with a 2-day washout between. Dose started at 900 mg over 3 divided doses then, in subsequent participants, was reduced to 600 mg, then 300 mg. Primary outcome was seizure frequency measured on continuous video-EEG in those completing the trial. Prolonged QT interval occurred in the first 2 patients at doses of 900 and 600 mg quinidine per day, respectively, despite serum quinidine levels well below the therapeutic range (0.61 and 0.51 μg/mL, reference range 1.3-5.0 μg/mL). Four patients completed treatment with 300 mg/d without adverse events. Patients completing the trial had very frequent seizures (mean 14 per day, SD 7, median 13, interquartile range 10-18).

{"id": 2315, "text": "A large amount of preparation goes into setting up trials. Different challenges and lessons are experienced. Our trial, testing a treatment for nodding syndrome, an acquired neurological disorder of unknown cause affecting thousands of children in Eastern Africa, provides a unique case study. As part of a study to determine the aetiology, understand pathogenesis and develop specific treatment, we set up a clinical trial in a remote district hospital in Uganda. This paper describes our experiences and documents supportive structures (enablers), challenges faced and lessons learned during set-up of the trial. Protocol development started in September 2015 with phased recruitment of a critical study team. The team spent 12 months preparing trial documents, procurement and training on procedures. Potential recruitment sites were pre-visited, and district and local leaders met as key stakeholders. Key enablers were supportive local leadership and investment by the district and Ministry of Health. The main challenges were community fears about nodding syndrome, adverse experiences of the community during previous research and political involvement. Other challenges included the number and delays in protocol approvals and lengthy procurement processes. This hard-to-reach area has frequent power and Internet fluctuations, which may affect cold chains for study samples, communication and data management. These concerns decreased with a pilot community engagement programme. Experiences and lessons learnt can reduce the duration of processes involved in trial-site set-up. A programme of community engagement and local leader involvement may be key to the success of a trial and in reducing community opposition towards participation in research.", "labels": []}
{"id": 2316, "text": "Patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, a rare, severe form of epileptic encephalopathy, are frequently treatment resistant to available medications. No controlled studies have investigated the use of cannabidiol for patients with seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. We therefore assessed the efficacy and safety of cannabidiol as an add-on anticonvulsant therapy in this population of patients. In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial done at 24 clinical sites in the USA, the Netherlands, and Poland, we investigated the efficacy of cannabidiol as add-on therapy for drop seizures in patients with treatment-resistant Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Eligible patients (aged 2-55 years) had Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, including a history of slow (<3 Hz) spike-and-wave patterns on electroencephalogram, evidence of more than one type of generalised seizure for at least 6 months, at least two drop seizures per week during the 4-week baseline period, and had not responded to treatment with at least two antiepileptic drugs. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) using an interactive voice response system, stratified by age group, to receive 20 mg/kg oral cannabidiol daily or matched placebo for 14 weeks. All patients, caregivers, investigators, and individuals assessing data were masked to group assignment. The primary endpoint was percentage change from baseline in monthly frequency of drop seizures during the treatment period, analysed in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug and had post-baseline efficacy data. All randomly assigned patients were included in the safety analyses. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02224690. Between April 28, 2015, and Oct 15, 2015, we randomly assigned 171 patients to receive cannabidiol (n=86) or placebo (n=85). 14 patients in the cannabidiol group and one in the placebo group discontinued study treatment; all randomly assigned patients received at least one dose of study treatment and had post-baseline efficacy data. The median percentage reduction in monthly drop seizure frequency from baseline was 43·9% (IQR -69·6 to -1·9) in the cannibidiol group and 21·8% (IQR -45·7 to 1·7) in the placebo group. The estimated median difference between the treatment groups was -17·21 (95% CI -30·32 to -4·09; p=0·0135) during the 14-week treatment period. Adverse events occurred in 74 (86%) of 86 patients in the cannabidiol group and 59 (69%) of 85 patients in the placebo group; most were mild or moderate. The most common adverse events were diarrhoea, somnolence, pyrexia, decreased appetite, and vomiting. 12 (14%) patients in the cannabidiol group and one (1%) patient in the placebo group withdrew from the study because of adverse events. One patient (1%) died in the cannabidiol group, but this was considered unrelated to treatment. Add-on cannabidiol is efficacious for the treatment of patients with drop seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and is generally well tolerated. The long-term efficacy and safety of cannabidiol is currently being assessed in the open-label extension of this trial.

Self-report questionnaires were used to measure disease-specific self-efficacy as the primary outcome measure and general self-efficacy, adherence, seizure severity, emotional functioning, quality of life, proactive coping, and side-effects of antiepileptic drugs (AED) as secondary outcome measures.

Endpoints were analyzed for subgroups of patients who received CBZ (or any VGSC inhibitor [VGSCi]) during baseline versus those who received other AEDs. Of 365 patients in the studies, 332 were evaluable for efficacy. The higher risk of study exit in the subgroups that received CBZ (or any VGSCi) during baseline, versus other AEDs, was not statistically significant (hazard ratios were 1.49 for +CBZ vs -CBZ [P = .10] and 1.27 for +VGSCi vs. -VGSCi [P = .33]).

There were no notable differences in overall tolerability between subgroups, but the incidence of some adverse events (eg, dizziness, somnolence, nausea) differed between subgroups and/or between treatment periods. Baseline use of CBZ or other major putative VGSC inhibitors did not appear to significantly increase the risk of study exit due to worsening seizure control, or to increase the frequency of side effects when converting to ESL monotherapy.

{"id": 2322, "text": "People with an intellectual (learning) disability (ID) and epilepsy have an increased seizure frequency, higher frequencies of multiple antiepileptic drug (AED) use and side effects, higher treatment costs, higher mortality rates and more behavioural problems than the rest of the population with epilepsy. The introduction of nurse-led care may lead to improvements in outcome for those with an ID and epilepsy; however, this has not been tested in a definitive clinical trial. To determine whether or not ID nurses, using a competency framework developed to optimise nurse management of epilepsy in people with an ID, can cost-effectively improve clinical and quality-of-life outcomes in the management of epilepsy compared with treatment as usual. Cluster-randomised two-arm trial. Community-based secondary care delivered by members of community ID teams. Participants were adults aged 18-65 years with an ID and epilepsy under the care of a community ID team and had had at least one seizure in the 6 months before the trial. The experimental intervention was the Learning Disability Epilepsy Specialist Nurse Competency Framework. This provides guidelines describing a structure and goals to support the delivery of epilepsy care and management by ID-trained nurses. The primary outcome was the seizure severity scale from the Epilepsy and Learning Disabilities Quality of Life questionnaire. Measures of mood, behaviour, AED side effects and carer strain were also collected. A cost-utility analysis was undertaken along with a qualitative examination of carers' views of participants' epilepsy management. In total, 312 individuals were recruited into the study from 17 research clusters. Using an intention-to-treat analysis controlling for baseline individual-level and cluster-level variables there was no significant difference in seizure severity score between the two arms. Altogether, 238 complete cases were included in the non-imputed primary analysis. Analyses of the secondary outcomes revealed no significant differences between arms. A planned subgroup analysis identified a significant interaction between treatment arm and level of ID. There was a suggestion in those with mild to moderate ID that the competency framework may be associated with a small reduction in concerns over seizure severity (standard error 2.005, 95% confidence interval -0.554 to 7.307; p = 0.092). However, neither subgroup showed a significant intervention effect individually. Family members' perceptions of nurses' management depended on the professional status of the nurses, regardless of trial arm. Economic analysis suggested that the competency framework intervention was likely to be cost-effective, primarily because of a reduction in the costs of supporting participants compared with treatment as usual. The intervention could not be delivered blinded. Treatment as usual varied widely between the research sites. Overall, for adults with an ID and epilepsy, the framework conferred no clinical benefit compared with usual treatment. The economic analysis suggested that there may be a role for the framework in enhancing the cost-effectiveness of support for people with epilepsy and an ID. Future research could explore the specific value of the competency framework for those with a mild to moderate ID and the potential for greater long-term benefits arising from the continuing professional development element of the framework.

Our objective was to evaluate a group self-management education courses for people with epilepsy and drug-resistant seizures by means of a multicenter, pragmatic, parallel group, randomized controlled trial. We recruited adults with epilepsy, having ≥2 seizures in the prior 12 months, from specialist clinics. Consenting participants were randomized 1:1 to a group course or treatment as usual. The primary outcome measure was quality of life 12 months after randomization using Quality of Life 31-P (QOLIE-31-P). Secondary outcome measures were seizure frequency and recency, psychological distress, impact and stigma of epilepsy, self-mastery, medication adherence, and adverse effects. Analysis of outcomes followed the intention-to-treat principle using mixed-effects regression models. We enrolled 404 participants (intervention: n = 205, control: n = 199) with 331 (82%) completing 12-month follow-up (intervention: n = 163, control: n = 168).

There was no significant difference in proportions of responders between progesterone and placebo in the catamenial and noncatamenial strata. Prespecified secondary analysis showed that the level of perimenstrual seizure exacerbation is a significant predictor of the responder rate for progesterone therapy.

To determine if, in pregnant women with epilepsy on AEDs, additional therapeutic drug monitoring reduces seizure deterioration compared with clinical features monitoring after a reduction in serum AED levels. A double-blind, randomised trial nested within a cohort study was conducted and a qualitative study of acceptability of the two strategies was undertaken. Stratified block randomisation with a 1 : 1 allocation method was carried out. Fifty obstetric and epilepsy clinics in secondary and tertiary care units in the UK. Pregnant women with epilepsy on one or more of the following AEDs: lamotrigine, carbamazepine, phenytoin or levetiracetam. Women with a ≥ 25% decrease in serum AED level from baseline were randomised to therapeutic drug monitoring or clinical features monitoring strategies. In the therapeutic drug monitoring group, clinicians had access to clinical findings and monthly serum AED levels to guide AED dosage adjustment for seizure control. In the clinical features monitoring group, AED dosage adjustment was based only on clinical features. Primary outcome - seizure deterioration, defined as time to first seizure and to all seizures after randomisation per woman until 6 weeks post partum. Secondary outcomes - pregnancy complications in mother and offspring, maternal quality of life, seizure rates in cohorts with stable serum AED level, AED dose exposure and adverse events related to AEDs. Analysis of time to first and to all seizures after randomisation was performed using a Cox proportional hazards model, and multivariate failure time analysis by the Andersen-Gill model. The effects were reported as hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Secondary outcomes were reported as mean differences (MDs) or odds ratios. A total of 130 women were randomised to the therapeutic drug monitoring group and 133 to the clinical features monitoring group; 294 women did not have a reduction in serum AED level. A total of 127 women in the therapeutic drug monitoring group and 130 women in the clinical features monitoring group (98% of complete data) were included in the primary analysis. There were no significant differences in the time to first seizure (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.2) or timing of all seizures after randomisation (HR 1.3, 95% CI 0.7 to 2.5) between both trial groups. In comparison with the group with stable serum AED levels, there were no significant increases in seizures in the clinical features monitoring (odds ratio 0.93, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.5) or therapeutic drug monitoring group (odds ratio 0.93, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.5) associated with a reduction in serum AED levels. Maternal and neonatal outcomes were similar in both groups, except for higher cord blood levels of lamotrigine (MD 0.55 mg/l, 95% CI 0.11 to 1 mg/l) or levetiracetam (MD 7.8 mg/l, 95% CI 0.86 to 14.8 mg/l) in the therapeutic drug monitoring group than in the clinical features monitoring group. There were no differences between the groups on daily AED exposure or quality of life. An increase in exposure to lamotrigine, levetiracetam and carbamazepine significantly increased the cord blood levels of the AEDs, but not maternal or fetal complications. Women with epilepsy perceived the need for weighing up their increased vulnerability to seizures during pregnancy against the side effects of AEDs. Fewer women than the original target were recruited. There is no evidence to suggest that regular monitoring of serum AED levels in pregnancy improves seizure control or affects maternal or fetal outcomes. Further evaluation of the risks of seizure deterioration for various threshold levels of reduction in AEDs and the long-term neurodevelopment of infants born to mothers in both randomised groups is needed. An individualised prediction model will help to identify those women who need close monitoring in pregnancy. Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN01253916.

We investigated the efficacy and safety of cannabidiol added to a regimen of conventional antiepileptic medication to treat drop seizures in patients with the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, a severe developmental epileptic encephalopathy. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted at 30 clinical centers, we randomly assigned patients with the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (age range, 2 to 55 years) who had had two or more drop seizures per week during a 28-day baseline period to receive cannabidiol oral solution at a dose of either 20 mg per kilogram of body weight (20-mg cannabidiol group) or 10 mg per kilogram (10-mg cannabidiol group) or matching placebo, administered in two equally divided doses daily for 14 weeks. The primary outcome was the percentage change from baseline in the frequency of drop seizures (average per 28 days) during the treatment period. A total of 225 patients were enrolled; 76 patients were assigned to the 20-mg cannabidiol group, 73 to the 10-mg cannabidiol group, and 76 to the placebo group. During the 28-day baseline period, the median number of drop seizures was 85 in all trial groups combined. The median percent reduction from baseline in drop-seizure frequency during the treatment period was 41.9% in the 20-mg cannabidiol group, 37.2% in the 10-mg cannabidiol group, and 17.2% in the placebo group (P=0.005 for the 20-mg cannabidiol group vs. placebo group, and P=0.002 for the 10-mg cannabidiol group vs. placebo group). The most common adverse events among the patients in the cannabidiol groups were somnolence, decreased appetite, and diarrhea; these events occurred more frequently in the higher-dose group. Six patients in the 20-mg cannabidiol group and 1 patient in the 10-mg cannabidiol group discontinued the trial medication because of adverse events and were withdrawn from the trial. Fourteen patients who received cannabidiol (9%) had elevated liver aminotransferase concentrations. Among children and adults with the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, the addition of cannabidiol at a dose of 10 mg or 20 mg per kilogram per day to a conventional antiepileptic regimen resulted in greater reductions in the frequency of drop seizures than placebo. Adverse events with cannabidiol included elevated liver aminotransferase concentrations.

They were randomized to either 12 weeks on the modified Atkins diet (diet group) or habitual diet (control group). Primary endpoint was a change in seizure frequency from baseline to the intervention period, comparing those on diet with controls.

This post-hoc analysis focused on paediatric patients (age <18 years) in the EXIST-3 trial, which consisted of baseline (8 weeks), core (18 weeks), and extension phases (≥48 weeks) and was done at 99 centres in 25 countries worldwide. Briefly, patients with tuberous sclerosis complex-associated treatment-refractory seizures, who were receiving a stable dose of one to three antiepileptic drugs, were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive placebo, low-exposure everolimus (3-7 ng/mL), or high-exposure everolimus (9-15 ng/mL). Following the core phase, patients could enter the extension phase to receive everolimus at a targeted exposure range of 3-15 ng/mL up to 48 weeks after the last patient had completed the core phase. Efficacy endpoints were response rate (≥50% of reduction from baseline in average weekly seizure frequency) and median percentage reduction in seizure frequency during the 12-week maintenance period of the core phase, and at 12-week intervals throughout the extension phase. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01713946. Between July 3, 2013, and May 29, 2015, 299 paediatric patients enrolled in the trial. In the younger subgroup (<6 years; n=104), 34 received placebo, 33 low-exposure everolimus, and 37 high-exposure everolimus; in the older subgroup (≥6 years to <18 years; n=195), 62 received placebo, 63 low-exposure everolimus, and 70 high-exposure everolimus. At the end of the core phase, response rate was higher in the treatment groups than placebo in both the younger subgroup (17·6% [6·8-34·5] for placebo vs 30·3% [95% CI 15·6-48·7; p=0·2245] for low-exposure everolimus vs 59·5% [42·1-75·2; p=0·0003] for high-exposure everolimus) and the older subgroup (12·9% [5·7-23·9] vs 27·0% [16·6-39·7; p=0·0491] vs 30·0% [19·6-42·1; p=0·0179]), as were median reduction in seizure frequency (12·3% [95% CI -10·1 to 24·8] vs 29·3% [95% CI 13·4 to 46·3; p=0·0474] vs 54·7% [43·5 to 73·1; p<0·0001] in younger patients; 13·5% [-3·0 to 26·8] vs 31·0% [16·1 to 42·9; p=0·0128] vs 34·8% [26·7 to 41·3; p=0·0006] in older patients). The efficacy persisted, with sustained seizure reduction after 1 year of treatment across both paediatric subgroups (response rate 48·9% [95% CI 38·1-59·8] for the younger subgroup vs 47·2% [39·3-55·2] for the older subgroup; median percentage reduction in seizure frequency 48·4% [95% CI 34·3-73·6] vs 48·0% [38·2-57·5]). At the cutoff date for the extension phase, grade 3 or 4 adverse events were reported in 45 (45%) younger patients (commonly pneumonia [n=16]) and 74 (38%) older patients (commonly pneumonia [n=8] and stomatitis [n=6]). Two deaths (pneumonia, which was suspected to be treatment-related, and sudden unexplained death due to epilepsy) were reported. Adjunctive everolimus resulted in sustained reductions in seizure frequency after 1 year and was well tolerated in paediatric patients with treatment-refractory seizures associated with tuberous sclerosis complex.

A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial included ninety-nine (n = 99) subjects with DRE, aged 5-16 years (n = 85) and 17-45 years (n = 14). After randomization, subjects were given two, four, or six capsules per day of DHA (417.8 mg DHA and 50.8 mg EPA/capsule, n = 33), EPA (385.6 mg EPA and 81.2 mg DHA/capsule, n = 33), or placebo (high oleic acid sunflower oil, n = 33) for one year. The primary endpoint was the effect of treatment on rate of seizure. Random-effects negative binomial regression models were fitted to model the patients' total count of seizures per month. The treatment effects on seizure incidence rate ratio (IRR) were tested after controlling for the covariate effects of gender, age, rate of seizure per week at enrollment, type of seizure, and number of antiepileptic drug (AED) combinations used at enrollment. Fifty-nine subjects (n = 59) completed the study (59.6%). The average number of seizures per month were 9.7 ± 1.2 in the EPA group, 11.7 ± 1.5 in the DHA group, and 16.6 ± 1.5 in the placebo group.

Standard lipid fractions, lipoprotein(a), and C-reactive protein (CRP) were examined in a subset of those participating in the STEP-ONE trial, in which elderly patients with new epilepsy were randomized to treatment with carbamazepine, lamotrigine, or levetiracetam. Separate comparisons were made by individual AED, among those treated with statins, and, for CRP, among those treated with anti-inflammatory drugs. One hundred ninety-four patients had the aforementioned serologic measurements. In patients not taking statins, those treated with carbamazepine had higher total cholesterol than those treated with levetiracetam (+16.6 mg/dL, P = 0.053), with values from patients on lamotrigine intermediate, whereas cholesterol fractions were subject to drug-gender interactions which did not show a consistent pattern. Lipoprotein(a) was significantly lower in lamotrigine patients than in the carbamazepine and levetiracetam groups. After accounting for the effects of steroids, CRP was higher in carbamazepine patients than in other patients. Patients taking a statin had lower lipid levels than those not taking a statin regardless of AED, but the differences between statin-treated and non-statin-treated patients were much larger (50%-100% or more) in the lamotrigine and levetiracetam groups than in the carbamazepine group (P = 0.035 for interaction effect of statin use and AED on total cholesterol). Here, we demonstrate that carbamazepine significantly interferes with the ability of statins to lower total cholesterol, thus making it a poor choice for hyperlipidemic patients or those with cardiovascular disease.

{"id": 2352, "text": "Infantile spasms constitute a severe form of epileptic encephalopathy. In the International Collaborative Infantile Spasms Study (ICISS), we showed that combining vigabatrin with hormonal therapy was more effective than hormonal therapy alone at stopping spasms between days 14 and 42 of treatment. In this planned follow-up, we aimed to assess whether combination therapy was associated with improved developmental and epilepsy outcomes at 18 months of age. In ICISS, a multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial, infants were enrolled from 102 hospitals (three in Australia, 11 in Germany, two in New Zealand, three in Switzerland, and 83 in the UK). Eligible infants had a clinical diagnosis of infantile spasms and a hypsarrhythmic (or similar) electroencephalogram (EEG) no more than 7 days before enrolment. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) by a secure website to receive hormonal therapy with vigabatrin or hormonal therapy alone. If parents consented, there was an additional randomisation (1:1) of type of hormonal therapy used (prednisolone or tetracosactide depot). Block randomisation was stratified for hormonal treatment and risk of developmental impairment. Parents and clinicians were not masked to therapy, but investigators assessing epilepsy and developmental outcomes at 18 months were masked to treatment allocation. Minimum doses were oral prednisolone 10 mg four times a day or intramuscular tetracosactide depot 0·5 mg (40 IU) on alternate days with or without oral vigabatrin 100 mg/kg per day. The primary outcome at 18 months was development as assessed by the Vineland Adaptive Behaviour Scales (VABS) composite score. Secondary outcomes were the presence or absence of epileptic seizures or infantile spasms in the previous 28 days, as recorded by parents and carers, and the use of any anti-epileptic treatment (including ketogenic diet) in the previous 28 days. Analysis was by intention to treat. The trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry, number 54363174, and EudraCT, number 2006-000788-27. Between March 7, 2007, and May 22, 2014, 766 infants were screened and, of those, 377 were randomly assigned to hormonal therapy with vigabatrin (n=186) or hormonal therapy alone (n=191). 362 infants were assessed for developmental and epilepsy outcomes at 18 months, 181 in each treatment group. Mean VABS scores did not differ significantly between the combination therapy group and the hormonal therapy alone group (73·9 [SE 1·3] vs 72·7 [1·4], difference -1·2 [95% CI -4·9 to 2·6], p=0·55). Presence of epilepsy at the assessment at age 18 months was similar in both treatment groups (54 [30·0%] of 180 infants who received combination therapy vs 52 [29·2%] of 178 who received hormonal therapy alone; difference 0·8% [95% CI -8·8 to 10·4], p=0·90). Presence of spasms was also similar in both treatment groups (27 [15·0%] of 180 infants on combination therapy vs 28 [15·7%] of 178 on hormonal therapy alone; difference 0·7% [95% CI -6·9 to 8·3], p=0·85). At the 18-month assessment, 158 (44·1%) of 358 infants were on some form of anti-epileptic treatment. Initial control of spasms between days 14 and 42 of treatment was associated with higher mean VABS scores at 18 months (79·1 [SE 1·2] vs 63·2 [1·1], difference 15·9 [95% CI 12·4 to 19·5], p<0·001) and with higher likelihood of absence of seizures at 18 months (in 39 [17·0%] of 229 infants who achieved spasm cessation vs 67 [51·9%] of 129 who did not; difference 34·9% [24·8 to 45·0], p<0·001). Increasing lead-time to treatment was associated with lower VABS scores (analysis of variance: F[4,354]=6·38, p<0·001) and worse epilepsy outcomes (p=0·023). Combination therapy did not result in improved developmental or epilepsy outcomes at 18 months. However, early clinical response to treatment was associated with improved developmental and epilepsy outcomes at 18 months. Longer lead-time to treatment was associated with poorer outcomes.

Doses could be reduced if not tolerated or increased up to 30 mg/kg/d if thought to be of benefit. This interim analysis was based on a November 2016 data cut. Of 368 patients who completed treatment in GWPCARE3 and GWPCARE4, 366 (99.5%) enrolled in the OLE study (GWPCARE5). Median treatment duration was 38 weeks at a mean modal dose of 23 mg/kg/d. Most patients (92.1%) experienced adverse events (AEs), primarily of mild (32.5%) or moderate (43.4%) severity. The most common AEs were diarrhea (26.8%), somnolence (23.5%), and convulsion (21.3%). Thirty-five patients (9.6%) discontinued treatment due to AEs. Liver transaminase elevations were reported in 37 patients (10.1%), of whom 29 were receiving concomitant valproic acid; 34 cases resolved spontaneously or with dose modification of CBD or concomitant medication. Median reduction from baseline in drop seizure frequency (quantified monthly over 12-week periods) ranged from 48% to 60% through week 48. Median reduction in monthly total seizure frequency ranged from 48% to 57% across all 12-week periods through week 48. Eighty-eight percent of patients/caregivers reported an improvement in the patient's overall condition per the Subject/Caregiver Global Impression of Change scale. In this study, long-term add-on CBD treatment had an acceptable safety profile in patients with LGS and led to sustained reductions in seizures.", "labels": [[884, 887, "N"], [0, 43, "Patient"]]}

In this parallel-cohort (PC) randomized controlled trial (RCT), infants were randomly allocated to KD or high-dose ACTH. Those who could not be randomized were followed in a PC. Primary end point was electroclinical remission at day 28. Secondary end points were time to electroclinical remission, relapse after initial response, seizure freedom at last follow-up, adverse effects, and developmental progress. One hundred one infants were included: 32 in the RCT (16 KD; 16 ACTH) and 69 in the PC (37 KD; 32 ACTH). Electroclinical remission at day 28 was similar between KD and ACTH (RCT: 62% vs 69%; PC: 41% vs 38%; combined cohort: 47% vs 48%; KD vs ACTH, respectively). In the combined cohort, time to electroclinical remission was similar between both treatments (14 days for KD, 16 days for ACTH). However, relapse rates were 16% (KD) and 43% (ACTH, P = 0.09), and seizure freedom at last follow-up was 40% (KD) and 27% (ACTH, P = 0.18). Adverse effects needing acute medical intervention occurred more often with ACTH (30% with KD, 94% with ACTH, P < 0.001). Age-appropriate psychomotor development and adaptive behavior were similar. Without prior vigabatrin (VGB) treatment, remission at day 28 was 47% (KD) and 80% (ACTH, P = 0.02); relapse rates were 29% (KD) and 56% (ACTH, P = 0.13). Consequently, seizure freedom at last follow-up was similar. In infants with prior VGB, seizure freedom at last follow-up was 48% (KD) and 21% (ACTH, P = 0.05). The study is underpowered; therefore, its results should be interpreted with caution. KD is as effective as ACTH in the long term but is better tolerated. Without prior VGB treatment, ACTH remains the first choice to achieve short-term remission. However, with prior VGB, KD was at least as effective as ACTH in the short term and was associated with lower relapse rates in the long term; therefore, it represents an appropriate second-line treatment after VGB.", "labels": [[562, 577, "N"], [124, 150, "Patient"], [67, 120, "Control"], [257, 271, "Control"], [251, 253, "Intervention"], [619, 621, "Intervention"], [626, 630, "Control"], [653, 655, "Intervention"], [660, 664, "Control"], [38, 61, "Intervention"], [723, 725, "Intervention"], [730, 734, "Control"], [667, 823, "Outcome"], [798, 800, "Intervention"], [804, 808, "Control"], [932, 934, "Intervention"], [948, 952, "Control"], [988, 990, "Intervention"], [1001, 1005, "Control"], [1065, 1067, "Intervention"], [1078, 1082, "Control"], [1171, 1175, "Control"], [1186, 1188, "Intervention"], [1199, 1203, "Control"], [1364, 1366, "Intervention"], [1377, 1381, "Control"], [1418, 1420, "Intervention"], [1431, 1435, "Control"], [1579, 1581, "Intervention"], [1592, 1596, "Control"], [1695, 1697, "Intervention"], [1717, 1721, "Control"], [1881, 1883, "Intervention"], [1793, 1797, "Control"], [1913, 1917, "Control"], [825, 953, "Outcome_2nd"], [964, 1093, "Outcome_2nd"], [1095, 1215, "Outcome_2nd"], [1217, 1291, "Outcome_2nd"], [1293, 1392, "Outcome"], [1509, 1607, "Outcome_2nd"], [1394, 1446, "Outcome_2nd"], [1462, 1507, "Outcome_2nd"]]}

Effective psychosocial treatments such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) are rarely available to most PwE, which is one reason electronically delivered CBT (eCBT) is regarded as promising. This study examined an eCBT intervention, termed Emyna, that was tailored to suit the needs of PwE. It includes CBT-related content on depression, stress and anxiety, seizure triggers and auras, and lifestyle habits. The trial examined the efficacy of Emyna in reducing symptoms of depression (primary outcome) and anxiety as well as improving quality of life. Participants (N = 200) with epilepsy, a diagnosis of a depressive disorder, and at least moderate depressive symptoms were randomized to Emyna or care as usual. At baseline and after 3, 6, and 9 months, participants were invited to complete online questionnaires. The primary outcome was improvement of depressive symptoms at 3 months. Relative to the control group, intervention group participants experienced significantly greater improvements in depression, anxiety, stress, social-occupational impairment, and epilepsy-related quality of life, in both intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol analyses. In ITT analyses, effects of medium magnitude were observed, as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 items (Cohen d = 0.54, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.25-0.82, P < 0.001) and the Neurological Disorders Depression Inventory for Epilepsy (d = 0.51, 95% CI = 0.23-0.79, P < 0.01). At 3 months, intervention group participants also reported fewer illness-related days off work and fewer days hospitalized over the preceding months, compared to control group participants (P ≤ 0.05), whereas no such differences were present at baseline (P > 0.30). These findings showed that Emyna, used adjunctively to usual care, could help improve mental health, social-occupational functioning, and quality of life among PwE.

There has been a consistent epidemiological association with infection by the filarial parasite, Onchocerca volvulus and antibodies to leiomodin and DJ-1, cross-reacting with O.volvulus proteins, have been reported. We hypothesized that nodding syndrome is a neuro-inflammatory disorder, induced by antibodies to O.volvulus or its symbiont, Wolbachia, cross-reacting with human neuron proteins and that doxycycline, which kills Onchocerca through effects on Wolbachia, may be used as treatment. This will be a two-arm, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised phase II trial of doxycycline 100 mg daily for six weeks in 230 participants. Participants will be patients' ages≥8 years with nodding syndrome. They will receive standard of care supportive treatment. All will be hospitalised for 1-2 weeks during which time baseline measurements including clinical assessments, EEG, cognitive and laboratory testing will be performed and antiepileptic drug doses rationalised. Participants will then be randomised to either oral doxycycline (Azudox®, Kampala Pharmaceutical Industries) 100 mg daily or placebo. Treatment will be initiated in hospital and continued at home. Participants will be visited at home at 2, 4 and 6 weeks for adherence monitoring. Study outcomes will be assessed at 6, 12, 18 and 24-month visits. Analysis will be by intention to treat.

This rare worked example of how fidelity can be assessed could also provide guidance sought by neurology trialists on how to assess fidelity. 53 patients who had visited ED on ≥2 occasions in prior year were recruited for the trial; 26 were randomized to the intervention. 7 intervention courses were delivered for them by one facilitator. Using audio recordings, treatment adherence and competence were assessed. Adherence was assessed by a checklist of the items comprising the intervention. Using computer software, competence was measured by calculating facilitator speech during the intervention (didacticism). Interrater reliability was evaluated by two independent raters assessing each course using the measures and their ratings being compared. The fidelity measures were found to be reliable. For the adherence instrument, raters agreed 96% of the time, PABAK-OS kappa 0.91. For didacticism, raters' scores had an intraclass coefficient of 0.96. In terms of treatment fidelity, not only were courses found to have been delivered with excellent adherence (88% of its items were fully delivered) but also as intended they were highly interactive, with the facilitator speaking for, on average, 55% of course time.

Seven participants with a photoparoxysmal response to intermittent photic stimulation (IPS) at baseline were randomized in a double-blind, 4-period cross-over study examining single doses of 17.5 and 52.5 mg PF-06372865, 2 mg lorazepam (active control), and placebo. Standardized photosensitivity ranges (SPRs) to IPS were recorded at screening, predose, and 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours postdose. The primary endpoint was the average least squares mean change in the SPR in the participant's most sensitive eye condition, across all time points. Both doses of PF-06372865 produced a marked and statistically significant mean reduction in SPR compared to placebo, which was similar in degree to lorazepam. There was complete suppression of SPR in 6/7 participants following PF-06372865 or lorazepam administration. PF-06372865 was safe and well-tolerated. PF-06372865 demonstrated highly robust efficacy.

This open-label, randomised clinical trial was undertaken at 30 UK emergency departments at secondary and tertiary care centres. Participants aged 6 months to under 18 years, with convulsive status epilepticus requiring second-line treatment, were randomly assigned (1:1) using a computer-generated randomisation schedule to receive levetiracetam (40 mg/kg over 5 min) or phenytoin (20 mg/kg over at least 20 min), stratified by centre.

Stiripentol inhibits the metabolism of clobazam and valproate, often requiring dose adjustment. Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice: Stiripentol, a direct allosteric modulator of GABAA receptors, offers a novel approach to treatment in patients with Dravet syndrome, both with and without pathogenic variants of the sodium channel α-1 subunit gene, and potentially other refractory seizures. Although available outside the United States for a decade, it was only recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for patients 2 years of age and older with Dravet syndrome taking clobazam. Conclusions: Stiripentol is an effective adjunctive therapy for reducing the frequency and duration of refractory seizures in patients with Dravet syndrome. Its role in the treatment of other refractory epilepsies requires further study.", "labels": []}
{"id": 2390, "text": "To determine whether a less-invasive approach to surgery for medically refractory temporal lobe epilepsy is associated with lower health care costs and costs of lost productivity over time, compared to open surgery. We compared direct medical costs and indirect productivity costs associated with treatment with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) or anterior temporal lobectomy (ATL) in the ROSE (Radiosurgery or Open Surgery for Epilepsy) trial. Health care use was abstracted from hospital bills, the study database, and diaries in which participants recorded health care use and time lost from work while seeking care. Costs of use were calculated using a Medicare costing approach used in a prior study of the costs of ATL. The power of many analyses was limited by the sample size and data skewing. Combined treatment and follow-up costs (in thousands of US dollars) did not differ between SRS (n = 20, mean = $76.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 50.7-115.6) and ATL (n = 18, mean = $79.0, 95% CI = 60.09-103.8). Indirect costs also did not differ. More ATL than SRS participants were free of consciousness-impairing seizures in each year of follow-up (all P < 0.05). Costs declined following ATL (P = 0.005). Costs tended to increase over the first 18 months following SRS (P = 0.17) and declined thereafter (P = 0.06). This mostly reflected hospitalizations for SRS-related adverse events in the second year of follow-up. Lower initial costs of SRS for medial temporal lobe epilepsy were largely offset by hospitalization costs related to adverse events later in the course of follow-up. Future studies of less-invasive alternatives to ATL will need to assess adverse events and major costs systematically and prospectively to understand the economic implications of adopting these technologies.", "labels": [[901, 903, "N"], [975, 977, "N"], [61, 104, "Patient"], [347, 380, "Control"], [892, 895, "Intervention"], [966, 969, "Control"], [1066, 1069, "Intervention"], [1641, 1644, "Control"], [1450, 1453, "Intervention"], [1458, 1487, "Patient"], [297, 343, "Intervention"], [720, 723, "Control"], [1057, 1060, "Control"], [1196, 1199, "Control"], [1273, 1276, "Intervention"], [1367, 1370, "Intervention"], [801, 1014, "Outcome"], [1016, 1050, "Outcome"], [1052, 1169, "Outcome"], [1171, 1211, "Outcome_2nd"], [1213, 1322, "Outcome_2nd"]]}

{"id": 2401, "text": "Many compounds that appear promising in preclinical species, fail in human clinical trials due to safety concerns. The FDA has strongly encouraged the application of modeling in drug development to improve product safety. This study illustrates how DILIsym, a computational representation of liver injury, was able to reproduce species differences in liver toxicity due to PF-04895162 (ICA-105665). PF-04895162, a drug in development for the treatment of epilepsy, was terminated after transaminase elevations were observed in healthy volunteers (NCT01691274). Liver safety concerns had not been raised in preclinical safety studies. DILIsym, which integrates in vitro data on mechanisms of hepatotoxicity with predicted in vivo liver exposure, reproduced clinical hepatotoxicity and the absence of hepatotoxicity observed in the rat. Simulated differences were multifactorial. Simulated liver exposure was greater in humans than rats. The simulated human hepatotoxicity was demonstrated to be due to the interaction between mitochondrial toxicity and bile acid transporter inhibition; elimination of either mechanism from the simulations abrogated injury. The bile acid contribution occurred despite the fact that the IC50 for bile salt export pump (BSEP) inhibition by PF-04895162 was higher (311 µmol/L) than that has been generally thought to contribute to hepatotoxicity. Modeling even higher PF-04895162 liver exposures than were measured in the rat safety studies aggravated mitochondrial toxicity but did not result in rat hepatotoxicity due to insufficient accumulation of cytotoxic bile acid species. This investigative study highlights the potential for combined in vitro and computational screening methods to identify latent hepatotoxic risks and paves the way for similar and prospective studies.", "labels": []}

Participants were adults with epilepsy, in whom treatment with newer generation AEDs was initiated or needed adjustment.

We aimed to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of adjunctive cenobamate in patients with uncontrolled focal (partial)-onset epilepsy. We did a multicentre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, dose-response study at 107 epilepsy and neurology centres in 16 countries.

Patients, investigators, and study personnel were masked to treatment assignment. The study included a 6-week titration phase and 12-week maintenance phase. The primary efficacy outcomes were percentage change in 28-day focal seizure frequency (focal aware motor, focal impaired awareness, or focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures) from baseline analysed in the modified intention-to-treat population (≥1 dose and any post-baseline seizure data) and responder rates (≥50% reduction) analysed in the maintenance phase population (≥1 dose in the maintenance phase and any maintenance phase seizure data). The primary efficacy outcomes were analysed using a hierarchal step-down procedure comparing 200 mg versus placebo, 400 mg versus placebo, then 100 mg versus placebo.

Therefore, this study aimed to examine the efficacy of a mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for sexuality (MBCT-S) on sexual function and intimacy among older adult WWE in Iran. A multicenter randomized controlled trial was conducted at 15 neurology clinics in three Iranian cities. WWE together with their partners and healthcare providers were randomly assigned in patient and partner (PP; n = 220), patient, partner, and healthcare provider (PPHP; n = 220), or treatment as usual (TAU; n = 220) group. WWE and their partners in both the PP and PPHP groups received eight weeks of MBCT-S sessions. In the PPHP group, three individual sessions on sexual counseling were added for healthcare providers. Self-assessment scales were used at baseline, one month and six months after completing the intervention. Mixed linear regression models were developed to determine differences among the three groups. Multilevel mediation analyses were conducted to understand the mediating effects of mindfulness, intimacy, patient-physicians relationship and sexual counseling barriers. Improvements in sexual function, sexual distress, and intimacy were found in both the PP and PPHP groups at one-month and six-month follow-ups. The PPHP group compared with the PP group had greater improvement in intimacy at both follow-ups. Regarding sexual function, the PPHP group performed better than the PP group at the six-month follow-up. The MBCT-S appears efficacious in enhancing sexual function and reducing sex-related distress in Iranian older adult WWE.

To determine whether fenfluramine reduced monthly convulsive seizure frequency relative to placebo in patients with Dravet syndrome who were taking stiripentol-inclusive regimens. This double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group randomized clinical trial was conducted in multiple centers. Eligible patients were children aged 2 to 18 years with a confirmed clinical diagnosis of Dravet syndrome who were receiving stable, stiripentol-inclusive antiepileptic drug regimens. Patients with 6 or more convulsive seizures during the 6-week baseline period were randomly assigned to receive fenfluramine, 0.4 mg/kg/d (maximum, 17 mg/d), or a placebo. After titration (3 weeks), patients' assigned dosages were maintained for 12 additional weeks. Caregivers recorded seizures via a daily electronic diary. The primary efficacy end point was the change in mean monthly convulsive seizure frequency between fenfluramine and placebo during the combined titration and maintenance periods relative to baseline. A total of 115 eligible patients were identified; of these, 87 patients (mean [SD], age 9.1 [4.8] years; 50 male patients [57%]; mean baseline frequency of seizures, approximately 25 convulsive seizures per month) were enrolled and randomized to fenfluramine, 0.4 mg/kg/d (n = 43) or placebo (n = 44). Patients treated with fenfluramine achieved a 54.0% (95% CI, 35.6%-67.2%; P < .001) greater reduction in mean monthly convulsive seizure frequency than those receiving the placebo. With fenfluramine, 54% of patients demonstrated a clinically meaningful (≥50%) reduction in monthly convulsive seizure frequency vs 5% with placebo (P < .001). The median (range) longest seizure-free interval was 22 (3.0-105.0) days with fenfluramine and 13 (1.0-40.0) days with placebo (P = .004).

The aim of the present study was to assess the efficacy and safety of fenfluramine in patients with Dravet syndrome. In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, we enrolled children and young adults with Dravet syndrome. After a 6-week observation period to establish baseline monthly convulsive seizure frequency (MCSF; convulsive seizures were defined as hemiclonic, tonic, clonic, tonic-atonic, generalised tonic-clonic, and focal with clearly observable motor signs), patients were randomly assigned through an interactive web response system in a 1:1:1 ratio to placebo, fenfluramine 0·2 mg/kg per day, or fenfluramine 0·7 mg/kg per day, added to existing antiepileptic agents for 14 weeks. The primary outcome was the change in mean monthly frequency of convulsive seizures during the treatment period compared with baseline in the 0·7 mg/kg per day group versus placebo; 0·2 mg/kg per day versus placebo was assessed as a key secondary outcome.

A proof-of-concept randomized clinical trial was conducted in the Logo health zone in the Ituri province, Democratic Republic of Congo, to compare seizure frequencies in onchocerciasis-infected persons with epilepsy (PWE) randomized to one of two treatment arms: the anti-epileptic drug phenobarbital supplemented with ivermectin, versus phenobarbital alone. The primary endpoint was defined as the probability of being seizure-free at month 4. A secondary endpoint was defined as >50% reduction in seizure frequency at month 4, compared to baseline. Both endpoints were analyzed using multiple logistic regression. In longitudinal analysis, the probability of seizure freedom during the follow-up period was assessed for both treatment arms by fitting a logistic regression model using generalized estimating equations (GEE). Ninety PWE enrolled between October and November 2017 were eligible for analysis. A multiple logistic regression analysis showed a borderline association between ivermectin treatment and being seizure-free at month 4 (OR: 1.652, 95% CI 0.975-2.799; p = 0.062). There was no significant difference in the probability of experiencing >50% reduction of the seizure frequency at month 4 between the two treatment arms. Also, treatment with ivermectin did not significantly increase the odds of being seizure-free during the individual follow-up visits.

Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were assessed in patients receiving perampanel 4 mg/d at their TEAE onset. Outcomes were also assessed with/without enzyme-inducing antiseizure medications (EIASMs). The full analysis set included 979 patients with focal seizures (placebo: n = 616 [235 with FBTC seizures]; perampanel 4 mg/d: n = 363 [134 with FBTC seizures]).

This double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial (GWPCARE2) recruited patients from April 13, 2015, to November 10, 2017, with follow-up completed on April 9, 2018. Of 285 patients screened from 38 centers in the United States, Spain, Poland, the Netherlands, Australia, and Israel, 86 were excluded, and 199 were randomized. Patients were aged 2 to 18 years with a confirmed diagnosis of Dravet syndrome and at least 4 convulsive seizures during the 4-week baseline period while receiving at least 1 antiepileptic drug. Data were analyzed from November 16 (date of unblinding) to December 13 (date of final outputs), 2018, based on intention to treat and per protocol. Patients received cannabidiol oral solution at a dose of 10 or 20 mg/kg per day (CBD10 and CBD20 groups, respectively) or matched placebo in 2 equally divided doses for 14 weeks. All patients, caregivers, investigators, and individuals assessing data were blinded to group assignment.

We developed a novel remotely delivered group-format epilepsy self-management program (Self-management for people with epilepsy and a history of negative health events; SMART). In a 6-month randomized controlled trial (RCT), SMART participants had significant decreases in NHEs, as well changes in attitudes and behaviors compared to a wait-list (Sajatovic et al., 2018). This secondary analysis from the RCT characterizes the indirect causal effects of SMART on NHE improvements that may be mediated by specific improvements in self-management, self-efficacy, social support, quality of life, and depression symptom severity. Participants were adults with epilepsy and a NHE in the prior 6 months. There were 60 participants in each RCT arm (SMART versus wait-list) and assessments were conducted at baseline, 10 weeks and 24 weeks. The outcome was a binary variable measuring NHE improvement at week 24. A counterfactual-based mediation framework was used to determine whether improvements or changes in attitudes and behaviors at specific time points or across the study period, mediated the impact of SMART on NHE improvements. At week 24, SMART contributed to significant improvements in NHEs compared to those in wait-list (odds ratio = 3.2, p = 0.015). SMART was significantly associated with improvements and changes in aspects of self-management, self-efficacy, quality of life, and depression symptom severity at week 10, and significant improvements between baseline and week 24 in overall self-management and quality of life. Mediation analyses demonstrated that a portion of the effect (∼20-30 %; p < 0.05) of SMART on NHE improvement was also indirectly mediated by early improvements in depression symptom severity and quality of life. This mediation analysis of the SMART intervention demonstrates that in addition to its direct effect on improving NHEs in people with epilepsy, early improvements in depression symptom severity and quality of life indirectly mediated ∼20-30 % of the intervention's effect.

This was followed by a double-blind 1-week taper. The primary efficacy endpoint was log-transformed seizure rate (loge [24-hour seizure rate + 1]) for all FOS recorded during the double-blind V-EEG monitoring, evaluated in subjects who took ≥1 dose of study medication, experienced ≥1 baseline seizure(s), and had a treatment phase V-EEG. Safety and tolerability were assessed by adverse events (AEs), clinical laboratory data, physical/neurological examinations, vital signs, and electrocardiograms. Overall, 175 patients were randomized (mean age = 28.2 months; 59% male, 69% white, 30% Asian) in a 2:1:2 ratio to pregabalin 7 or 14 mg/kg/d (n = 71 or n = 34, respectively), or placebo (n = 70).

Unlike Cu.serum, the average four-month LEV Cu.PBMC displayed a significant positive correlation with clinical features and P-gp expression; where patients with higher LEV Cu.PBMC experienced less number of seizure/month, better cognition and quality of life, and had a more reduction in P-gp expression, but no significant correlation with LEV daily dose was observed. A therapeutic response threshold of ≥ 0.82 μg/mL for LEV Cu.PBMCwas perceived by using a receiver operating characteristic curve that related the number of seizure/month to the LEV Cu.PBMC. The validity of this therapeutic threshold was significant in contrast to LEV Cu.serum.

However, there is limited literature on the associations between health literacy and outcomes in patients with epilepsy, and thus, this secondary analysis investigates the associations between health literacy and outcomes in patients with epilepsy enrolled in the self-management intervention Self-management for people with epilepsy and a history of negative events (SMART). We examined the associations between higher health literacy and higher education level and outcomes of the SMART trial. This is a secondary analysis of data from the SMART self-management intervention, where individuals were randomized to the SMART intervention or a 6-month waitlist (WL) control. Health literacy was assessed at baseline before randomization using the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine (REALM-R). Education level was self-reported by participants at baseline. Pearson correlations between REALM-R scores and continuous demographic and clinical variables were conducted. Point-biserial Pearson correlations were computed for REALM-R and dichotomous variables. The effect of education on change in negative health events (NHEs) counts from baseline to six months was conducted using a linear regression. A logistic regression with health literacy and randomization arm as predictors and improvement in NHE (1 = improvement, 0 = no change or increased NHEs at 6 months) as the outcome was conducted. Lower education and lower income were significantly correlated with lower health literacy (p < 0.001 and p = 0.03).

It is anticipated that antiepileptic drugs such as stiripentol and valproate will be administered concomitantly with cannabidiol. This trial evaluated the effect of cannabidiol on steady-state pharmacokinetics of stiripentol or valproate in patients with epilepsy, and the safety and tolerability of cannabidiol. This phase II, two-arm, parallel-group, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial recruited male and female patients with epilepsy aged 16-55 years. Patients receiving a stable dose of stiripentol or valproate were randomized 4:1 to receive concomitant double-blind cannabidiol or placebo. Patients received plant-derived, highly purified cannabidiol medicine (Epidiolex ®  in the USA; Epidyolex ®  in the EU; 100 mg/mL oral solution) at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day from day 12 to 26, following a 10-day dose-escalation period. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic evaluations were collected on days 1 and 26 before stiripentol/valproate dosing and up to 12 h postdose. Treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) were recorded. In total, 35 patients were recruited to the stiripentol arm (n = 14) or the valproate arm (n = 21). Both the safety and the pharmacokinetic populations of the stiripentol arm comprised 14 patients (2 placebo; 12 cannabidiol). The safety population of the valproate arm comprised 20 patients (4 placebo; 16 cannabidiol; one withdrew before receiving treatment); the pharmacokinetic population comprised 15 patients (3 placebo; 12 cannabidiol). Concomitant cannabidiol led to a small increase in stiripentol exposure (17% increase in maximum observed plasma concentration [Cmax]; 30% increase in area under the concentration-time curve over the dosing interval [AUCtau]). Concomitant cannabidiol also had little effect on valproate exposure (13% decrease in Cmax; 17% decrease in AUCtau) or its metabolite, 2-propyl-4-pentenoic acid (4-ene-VPA) (23% decrease in Cmax; 30% decrease in AUCtau). All changes in exposure are expressed as the dose-normalized geometric mean (CV%) day 26 to day 1 ratio. The most common AE was diarrhea; most AEs were mild. Two patients discontinued cannabidiol because of serious AEs (rash [n = 1] in the stiripentol arm; hypertransaminasemia [n = 1] in the valproate arm). A separate in vitro study investigated the bidirectional effect of cannabidiol, or its metabolite 7-carboxy-cannabidiol, on valproate plasma protein binding; no change in plasma protein binding was observed for either compound. The clinical relevance of the increase in stiripentol exposure is unknown; patients receiving cannabidiol and stiripentol concomitantly should be monitored for adverse reactions as individual patient responses may vary. Coadministration of cannabidiol did not affect the pharmacokinetics of valproate or its metabolite, 4-ene-VPA, in adult patients with epilepsy.

Trial medication had to be administered within 30 min of qualifying seizure. Primary efficacy outcome was time to next seizure (clinical observation with electroencephalogram [EEG] confirmation) or to rescue medication use within 12 h of trial medication administration. Secondary outcomes included seizure freedom and rescue medication use within 12 h of trial medication administration. Safety and tolerability outcomes included treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). Overall, 46 patients were randomized, and 45 received trial medication for a qualifying seizure. Patients in the LZP arm had doses from 1 to 4 mg (median: 1 mg). Eleven of 45 patients had a seizure within 12 h of trial medication administration (LZP 5/15 [median time to next seizure: 5.55 h], BRV 100 mg 3/15 [5.97 h], BRV 200 mg 3/15 [3.60 h]). No patients received additional rescue medication to control their qualifying seizure. Most patients were seizure-free over 12 h (LZP 9/15 [60.0%], BRV 100 mg 12/15 [80.0%], BRV 200 mg 12/15 [80.0%]). Rescue medication use within 12 h was numerically higher for LZP (6/15 [40.0%]) vs. BRV 100 mg (1/15 [6.7%]) and vs. BRV 200 mg (2/15 [13.3%]). Treatment-emergent adverse events were reported by 5/16 (31.3%), 6/15 (40.0%), and 3/15 (20.0%) of LZP, BRV 100 mg, and BRV 200 mg patients; one LZP patient had a serious TEAE (seizure cluster). Most common TEAEs (≥10% of patients) were sedation and somnolence with LZP, and dizziness, headache, and nausea with BRV. Intravenous LZP, IV BRV 100 mg, and IV BRV 200 mg showed similar efficacy in controlling acute seizure activity in the EMU. Treatment-emergent adverse events were as expected for each medication. Although this trial should be interpreted with caution because of small patient numbers, it suggests a possible role of BRV in the acute treatment of increased seizure activity.", "labels": [[131, 263, "Patient"], [1012, 1014, "N"], [371, 409, "Patient"], [112, 127, "Control"], [435, 494, "Control"], [1249, 1252, "Control"], [1297, 1307, "Intervention"], [1480, 1483, "Control"], [1524, 1534, "Intervention"], [1612, 1615, "Control"], [1668, 1678, "Intervention"], [1799, 1809, "Intervention"], [1840, 1843, "Control"], [1961, 1965, "Control"], [2007, 2010, "Intervention"], [2012, 2028, "Control"], [2328, 2331, "Intervention"], [72, 107, "Intervention"], [1112, 1123, "Control"], [1323, 1333, "Intervention"], [1498, 1508, "Intervention"], [1635, 1645, "Intervention"], [1794, 1798, "Control"], [1815, 1825, "Intervention"], [2029, 2061, "Intervention"], [496, 527, "Intervention"], [1165, 1348, "Outcome"], [1350, 1435, "Outcome"], [1437, 1549, "Outcome_2nd"], [1551, 1693, "Outcome_2nd"], [1695, 1888, "Outcome_2nd"], [1890, 2010, "Outcome_2nd"]]}
{"id": 2441, "text": "When performed correctly, hyperventilation (HV) for three minutes provokes absence seizures in virtually all children, a finding suggestive of a diagnosis of childhood absence epilepsy (CAE). Interestingly, some children experience absence seizures while performing HV in the office yet do not experience absences during HV on subsequent routine EEG. In most instances, HV during routine EEG is performed in the supine position, while in the office HV is done with the child sitting-up. Therefore, we hypothesized that the position in which HV is performed may influence its yield in provoking absence seizures. We conducted a randomized multi-center controlled trial among children (4-10 years old) with suspected CAE. During a routine EEG, children were asked to perform HV twice, in the supine and sitting positions. Twenty children (four males) diagnosed with CAE were included in the analysis. Seventeen of the 20 patients experienced absence seizures while sitting and 13 experienced seizures during supine HV (p = 0.031). All patients that had absence seizures during supine HV also had seizures during sitting HV. Among patients with absences in both positions, seizure duration was significantly shorter during sitting HV (mean 8.69 seconds) than during supine HV (mean 12 seconds) (p = 0.042). An opposite tendency was seen in the younger age group (4-7 years), with shorter seizures in the supine HV group (5.6 seconds supine, 7.57 seconds sitting, p = 0.019).

While the benefit of playing Mozart K.448 music has been studied as an alternative, supplementary, nonpharmacologic treatment for epilepsy, the literature features limited few randomized controlled trial studies of children. We aimed to study the effect of Mozart K.448 for two pianos on interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs), quantitative electroencephalogram (qEEG), and heart rate variability (HRV) in patients with epilepsy. We employed a single-blinded randomized trial design with a placebo control. The treatment group listened to the first 8 min of Mozart K.448 for two pianos during EEG recording. The control group underwent an EEG recording of the same duration in a quiet environment. Interictal epileptiform discharges were manually counted for 8 min before, during, and after the song was plated. Quantitative electroencephalogram and HRV were analyzed in each period. A total of 32 patients aged 0-18 years were enrolled. There were 12 patients in the music group and 14 patients in the control group; 67% of the patients in the former exhibited significantly decreased IEDs while listening to the music compared with 42% of the patients in the quiet group (RR [Relative Risk Reduction]: 0.72, p-value: <0.001, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.69-0.74). During music exposure, qEEG demonstrated an increase in the delta/theta to alpha/beta ratio relative to that of controls (median in music: +3% and control: -6%, p-value: 0.520). Heart rate variability analyses showed a decrease in the ratio of low frequency to high frequency (LF/HF), which represents parasympathetic activity during music exposure (decrease of 34%, p-value: 0.382). The present study showed that Mozart K.448 reduced the number of IEDs in children with epilepsy and that Mozart K.448 could enhance parasympathetic activity.

This study was conducted in two stages: (1) the preparation phase, during which we developed a WEEP for epilepsy, and tested its content, quality, and usability; and (2) the implementation phase, during which we evaluated the efficacy of the website by assessing users' knowledge of epilepsy, seizure self-efficacy, attitudes, and e-health literacy. Before the implementation phase, data collection tools were used to test the prior knowledge of epilepsy of the participants and control groups. Next, the youth and their parents were asked to use the WEEP for 12 weeks, while a control group was not provided with additional education tools. Written consent was obtained from the participants prior to the study in addition to obtaining approval from the ethics committee and permission from the institution where the research was conducted. The data were finally analyzed using SAS 9.4 software. During the preparation phase, the website was developed and tested for content, quality, and usability. The WEEP was graded 72.7 ± 3.4 points by experts, 92.4 ± 1.63 by youth with epilepsy, and 92.31 ± 1.94 by the parents. During the implementation phase, the efficacy of the web site was evaluated through the assessment of participants' scores. We found that the mean knowledge, seizure self-efficacy, attitude, and e-health literacy scores of youth with epilepsy in the experimental group had significantly increased after the WEEP (p < 0.05). An increase in the scores of knowledge, anxiety, self-management, and e-health literacy scale was also found among the parents in the intervention group (p < 0.05). The content, quality, and usability of the WEEP were adequate and effective in improving knowledge, self-efficacy, attitudes, and e-health literacy of youth with epilepsy as well as those of their parents.", "labels": [[620, 793, "Patient"], [518, 555, "Patient"], [452, 495, "Intervention"], [927, 931, "Intervention"], [1070, 1081, "Intervention"], [1311, 1325, "Control"], [5, 42, "Patient"], [304, 361, "Patient"], [1333, 1400, "Intervention"], [1408, 1472, "Control"], [1833, 1841, "Intervention"], [2175, 2194, "Patient"], [1333, 1360, "Patient"], [1898, 1917, "Patient"], [1939, 1950, "Patient"], [2001, 2013, "Intervention"], [2255, 2263, "Intervention"], [2391, 2402, "Patient"], [2480, 2488, "Intervention"], [2592, 2645, "Patient"], [2076, 2274, "Outcome"], [1833, 1950, "Outcome_2nd"], [2276, 2439, "Outcome"]]}

Diagnostic pathways were compared. Potential clinical predictors for diagnostic success were evaluated. Length of in-hospital stay did not significantly differ between groups. Suspicion of PNES was confirmed in 43 of 77 (56%) patients, evenly distributed between group A (22 of 39) and group B (21 of 38). In nine patients, recorded habitual seizures were epileptic and in 25 cases, no diagnostic event could be recorded. Diagnosis of PNES was ascertained primarily by recording a typical seizure through suggestive induction in 24 patients and through long-term monitoring in 19 patients. In group A (induction first), monitoring was not deemed necessary in 21% of cases. In group B (monitoring first), 13% would have remained inconclusive without suggestive induction. Patients who reported triggers to their habitual seizures were not more likely to have spontaneous or provoked PNES during monitoring or suggestive inducion, respectively. Patients with subjective seizure prodromes (auras) were significantly more likely to have a PNES during suggestive induction than those without (odds ratio [OR] 3.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1-10.4). There was no significant difference in seizure frequency between patients with spontaneous PNES during long-term monitoring and those with nondiagnostic monitoring sessions.

We compared the rapidity of the effects of both drugs in the central nervous system (CNS) of patients with photosensitive epilepsy using time to PPR elimination post-intravenous infusion as a pharmacodynamic endpoint. Using a randomized, double-blind, two-period, balanced, crossover design, we tested patients with photosensitive epilepsy with equipotent milligram doses of intravenous LEV 1500 mg versus BRV 100 mg post-15-min intravenous infusion (part 1) and post-5-min intravenous infusion (part 2, same doses). Eight patients per part were deemed sufficient with 80% power to determine a 70% reduction for intravenous BRV:LEV intrapatient time ratio to PPR elimination, with a 0.05 two-sided significance level. Plasma antiseizure medicine concentrations were measured using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. Nine patients [six women; mean age 27.8 years (range 18-42)] completed the study; seven of these participated in both parts 1 and 2. In 31 of 32 instances, patients experienced PPR elimination.

However, BRV was faster when we excluded an outlier patient in part 1 (p = 0.0016). For our remaining primary outcome, parts 1 and 2 data combined, the median intrapatient BRV:LEV time ratio was 0.39 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.16-0.91], i.e., PPR elimination was 61% faster with BRV, p = 0.039.

Automated detection of PGES epochs may aid in reliable quantification of this phenomenon. We developed a voltage-based algorithm for detecting PGES. This algorithm applies existing criteria to simulate expert epileptologist readings. Validation relied on postictal EEG recording from patients undergoing ECT (NCT02761330), assessing concordance among the algorithm and four clinical epileptologists. We observed low-to-moderate concordance among epileptologist ratings of PGES. Despite this, the algorithm displayed high discriminability in comparison to individual epileptologists (C-statistic range: 0.86-0.92). The algorithm displayed high discrimination (C-statistic: 0.91) and substantial peak agreement (Cohen's Kappa: 0.65) in comparison to a consensus of clinical ratings. Interrater agreement between the algorithm and individual epileptologists was on par with that among expert epileptologists. An automated voltage-based algorithm can be used to detect PGES following ECT, with discriminability nearing that of experts.

Responder analyses help bridge this gap by showing proportions of patients who achieved various MCSF improvement levels. Deriving numbers needed to treat (NNTs) to achieve clinically desirable response levels can further inform individual decision-making. We calculated the NNT with fenfluramine to achieve clinically meaningful (≥50%) or profound (≥75%) MCSF reductions in patients with Dravet syndrome (DS). NNT to achieve ≥50% or ≥75% MCSF reduction was assessed using longitudinal data from two phase 3 studies for adjunctive fenfluramine in DS patients aged 2-18 years. NNT was calculated: 1/((Experimental-Responder Rate)-(Control-Responder Rate)). In Study 1, NNTs to achieve ≥50% and ≥75% MCSF reduction were 1.8 and 2.1 at 0.7 mg/kg/day fenfluramine. In Study 2, these NNTs were 2.0 and 3.1, respectively. These results were seen as early as Weeks 6-7 and were sustained through Weeks 14-15.

Those with active epilepsy were unemployed significantly more often and perceived their mental health significantly more affected than those seizure-free without treatment. Duration of initial ASM treatment was not associated with any difference in subsequent epilepsy risk. This indicates that the timing of withdrawal attempts is unlikely to alter the long-term prognosis of uncomplicated childhood epilepsy.

Participants and investigators were not masked and were aware of treatment allocation. SANAD II was designed to assess non-inferiority of both levetiracetam and zonisamide to lamotrigine for the primary outcome of time to 12-month remission. Anti-seizure medications were taken orally and for participants aged 12 years or older the initial advised maintenance doses were lamotrigine 50 mg (morning) and 100 mg (evening), levetiracetam 500 mg twice per day, and zonisamide 100 mg twice per day. For children aged between 5 and 12 years the initial daily maintenance doses advised were lamotrigine 1·5 mg/kg twice per day, levetiracetam 20 mg/kg twice per day, and zonisamide 2·5 mg/kg twice per day. All participants were included in the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. The per-protocol (PP) analysis excluded participants with major protocol deviations and those who were subsequently diagnosed as not having epilepsy. Safety analysis included all participants who received one dose of any study drug. The non-inferiority limit was a hazard ratio (HR) of 1·329, which equates to an absolute difference of 10%. A HR greater than 1 indicated that an event was more likely on lamotrigine. The trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry, 30294119 (EudraCt number: 2012-001884-64). 990 participants were recruited between May 2, 2013, and June 20, 2017, and followed up for a further 2 years. Patients were randomly assigned to receive lamotrigine (n=330), levetiracetam (n=332), or zonisamide (n=328). The ITT analysis included all participants and the PP analysis included 324 participants randomly assigned to lamotrigine, 320 participants randomly assigned to levetiracetam, and 315 participants randomly assigned to zonisamide. Levetiracetam did not meet the criteria for non-inferiority in the ITT analysis of time to 12-month remission versus lamotrigine (HR 1·18; 97·5% CI 0·95-1·47) but zonisamide did meet the criteria for non-inferiority in the ITT analysis versus lamotrigine (1·03; 0·83-1·28). The PP analysis showed that 12-month remission was superior with lamotrigine than both levetiracetam (HR 1·32 [97·5% CI 1·05 to 1·66]) and zonisamide (HR 1·37 [1·08-1·73]). There were 37 deaths during the trial. Adverse reactions were reported by 108 (33%) participants who started lamotrigine, 144 (44%) participants who started levetiracetam, and 146 (45%) participants who started zonisamide. Lamotrigine was superior in the cost-utility analysis, with a higher net health benefit of 1·403 QALYs (97·5% central range 1·319-1·458) compared with 1·222 (1·110-1·283) for levetiracetam and 1·232 (1·112, 1·307) for zonisamide at a cost-effectiveness threshold of £20 000 per QALY. Cost-effectiveness was based on differences between treatment groups in costs and QALYs. These findings do not support the use of levetiracetam or zonisamide as first-line treatments for patients with focal epilepsy. Lamotrigine should remain a first-line treatment for patients with focal epilepsy and should be the standard treatment in future trials.

{"id": 2498, "text": "Valproate is a first-line treatment for patients with newly diagnosed idiopathic generalised or difficult to classify epilepsy, but not for women of child-bearing potential because of teratogenicity. Levetiracetam is increasingly prescribed for these patient populations despite scarcity of evidence of clinical effectiveness or cost-effectiveness. We aimed to compare the long-term clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of levetiracetam compared with valproate in participants with newly diagnosed generalised or unclassifiable epilepsy. We did an open-label, randomised controlled trial to compare levetiracetam with valproate as first-line treatment for patients with generalised or unclassified epilepsy. Adult and paediatric neurology services (69 centres overall) across the UK recruited participants aged 5 years or older (with no upper age limit) with two or more unprovoked generalised or unclassifiable seizures.

Participants and investigators were aware of treatment allocation. For participants aged 12 years or older, the initial advised maintenance doses were 500 mg twice per day for levetiracetam and valproate, and for children aged 5-12 years, the initial daily maintenance doses advised were 25 mg/kg for valproate and 40 mg/kg for levetiracetam. All drugs were administered orally. SANAD II was designed to assess the non-inferiority of levetiracetam compared with valproate for the primary outcome time to 12-month remission.

The ITT analysis included all participants and the PP analysis included 255 participants randomly allocated to valproate and 254 randomly allocated to levetiracetam. Median age of participants was 13·9 years (range 5·0-94·4), 65% were male and 35% were female, 397 participants had generalised epilepsy, and 123 unclassified epilepsy. Levetiracetam did not meet the criteria for non-inferiority in the ITT analysis of time to 12-month remission (HR 1·19 [95% CI 0·96-1·47]); non-inferiority margin 1·314. The PP analysis showed that the 12-month remission was superior with valproate than with levetiracetam. There were two deaths, one in each group, that were unrelated to trial treatments. Adverse reactions were reported by 96 (37%) participants randomly assigned to valproate and 107 (42%) participants randomly assigned to levetiracetam. Levetiracetam was dominated by valproate in the cost-utility analysis, with a negative incremental net health benefit of -0·040 (95% central range -0·175 to 0·037) and a probability of 0·17 of being cost-effectiveness at a threshold of £20 000 per quality-adjusted life-year. Cost-effectiveness was based on differences between treatment groups in costs and quality-adjusted life-years.

Qualitative data analysis revealed that focus group participants identified geographic and social isolation, and the more limited access to epilepsy care, as the major barriers to epilepsy self-management for rural populations.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and effects on depressive symptoms of a culturally adapted version of UPLIFT for the Hispanic community. Hispanic patients with elevated depressive symptoms (n = 72) were enrolled from epilepsy clinics in New York City and randomized to UPLIFT or usual care.

{"id": 2505, "text": "Individuals with Dravet syndrome (DS) experience frequent pharmacoresistant seizures beginning in infancy. Most exhibit poor neurodevelopmental outcomes including motor function difficulties, behavior problems, and cognitive impairment. Cognitive deficits in children with DS have been associated with seizure frequency and antiseizure medication (ASM) use. Recent research in children and young adults with DS has begun to examine the role of executive functions (EFs), as these include higher-order cognitive functions and may mediate the relationship between risk factors and cognitive impairment. Current conceptualizations, however, of EFs involve the broader self-regulation of cognitive, behavioral, and emotional domains. We explored relationships between reduction in convulsive seizure frequency and everyday EFs in a subset of children and young adults with DS treated with adjunctive fenfluramine for 1 year. This is a post-hoc analysis of data from children and young adults with Dravet syndrome aged 5-18 years who participated in a phase 3 randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial (core study) followed by completion of at least 1 year of fenfluramine treatment in an open-label extension (OLE) study. Eligible children and young adults started the OLE study at 0.2 mg/kg/day fenfluramine and were titrated to optimal seizure control and tolerability (maximum daily dose: 26 mg/day). Parents/caregivers documented convulsive seizure frequency per 28 days (i.e., monthly convulsive seizure frequency [MCSF]) by electronic diary. A parent/caregiver for each child also completed the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF®) parent form, a questionnaire capturing parents'/caregivers' perceptions of everyday EF that was included as a safety measure to assess treatment-related adverse effects on EF during the trial. Ratings on BRIEF® were mapped to the current edition, the BRIEF®2 parent form, and were used to calculate T-scores for the Behavior Regulation Index (BRI), Emotion Regulation Index (ERI), Cognitive Regulation Index (CRI), and Global Executive Composite (GEC). Change in BRIEF®2 T-scores from baseline in the core study to Year 1 of the OLE study was calculated. Spearman's rho correlation coefficients assessed associations between change in BRIEF®2 indexes/composite T-scores and percentage change in MCSF. Children and young adults were divided into 2 groups based on percentage of MCSF reduction achieved from pre-randomization baseline in the core study to Year 1 of the OLE study: <50% and ≥50% MCSF reduction. Changes in the distribution of BRIEF®2 indexes/composite T-scores were compared between MCSF reduction groups using Mann-Whitney U tests. The proportions of children and young adults in these groups who showed clinically meaningful improvement in everyday EF, defined as Reliable Change Index (RCI) values ≥95% certainty relative to a reference population of neurotypically developing healthy volunteers, were then assessed by cross-tabulations and Somers' D tests (p ≤ 0.05). When there was a significant meaningful improvement in an index score, post-hoc analyses using the same statistical methods were conducted to evaluate the individual BRIEF®2 scales composing that index. Supplemental analyses examined the proportions of patients in MCSF reduction groups <25% and ≥75% who achieved clinically meaningful improvement or worsening in everyday EF using RCI values ≥95% certainty and ≥80% certainty, respectively, relative to the reference population. At the time of analysis, 58 children and young adults (mean age: 11 ± 4 years) had reached OLE Year 1 of fenfluramine treatment with a 75% median percentage reduction in seizure frequency from pre-randomization baseline.

We discuss the surgical technique of the implantation of DBS electrodes with special attention paid to the targeting methods of the ANT. Moreover, we present in detail the clinical efficacy of ANT DBS, with a special emphasis on the stimulation parameters, a stimulation mode, and polarity.

No significant cognitive declines or worsening of depressive symptoms was noted. At long-term follow-up, the quality-of-life scores have improved. The limitations of ANT DBS studies include a limited number of patients treated and mostly open-label designs with only one double-blind, randomized multicenter trial. Most studies do not report the etiology of intractable epilepsy or they include nonhomogeneous groups of patients affected by intractable epilepsy.

There are, however, few studies on treatment-related changes in cognitive functions. The main objective of this study was to investigate cognitive changes in patients receiving ANT-DBS. We also explored whether possible effects were related to stimulation duration and whether change in seizure frequency was associated with cognitive changes. Bilateral ANT electrodes were implanted in 18 patients with refractory epilepsy, aged 18-52 years. Immediately after implantation, patients were randomized to stimulation ON (n = 8) or OFF (n = 10) for the first 6 months (blinded phase). During the following 6-month open phase, both groups received stimulation. Neuropsychological assessments were conducted before implantation (T1), at the end of the blinded period (T2), and 1 year after implantation (T3). Groupwise comparisons across the three time points revealed changes in performance in two of 22 cognitive test scores: motor speed and sustained attention. We found no significant group differences in cognitive change from T1 to T2. Patients reported fewer symptoms of executive dysfunction after 12 months of stimulation. Patients showing significant improvement in seizure frequency had better performance in a measure of verbal learning. Our results indicate that ANT-DBS has very limited effects on cognitive functioning, as measured by formal tests after 6- or 12-month stimulation.

However, there is a paucity of research addressing the needs of PLWE in rural settings. The present study leverages collaboration between investigators from 2 mid-western US states (Ohio and Iowa) to replicate testing of the SMART intervention and prioritize delivery to PLWE in rural and semi-rural communities. In phase 1, investigators will refine the SMART program using input from community stakeholders. A Community Advisory Board will then be convened to help identify barriers to trial implementation and strategies to overcome barriers. In phase 2, the investigators will conduct a 6-month prospective randomized control trial of the SMART program compared to 6-month waitlist controls, with the primary outcome being changes in negative health events defined as seizure, self-harm attempt, emergency department visit, or hospitalization. Additional outcomes of interest include quality of life and physical and mental health functioning. The study will also assess process measures of program adopters and system end-users to inform future outreach, education, and self-management strategies for PLWE. The method of this study employs lived experience of PLWE and those who provide care for PLWE in rural and underserved populations to refine a remotely delivered Web-based self-management program, to improve recruitment and retention, and to deliver the intervention.

{"id": 2522, "text": "Following a single seizure, or recent epilepsy diagnosis, it is difficult to balance risk of medication side effects with the potential to prevent seizure recurrence. A prediction model was developed and validated enabling risk stratification which in turn informs treatment decisions and individualises counselling. Data from a randomised controlled trial was used to develop a prediction model for risk of seizure recurrence following a first seizure or diagnosis of epilepsy. Time-to-event data was modelled via Cox's proportional hazards regression. Model validity was assessed via discrimination and calibration using the original dataset and also using three external datasets - National General Practice Survey of Epilepsy (NGPSE), Western Australian first seizure database (WA) and FIRST (Italian dataset of people with first tonic-clonic seizures). People with neurological deficit, focal seizures, abnormal EEG, not indicated for CT/MRI scan, or not immediately treated have a significantly higher risk of seizure recurrence. Discrimination was fair and consistent across the datasets (c-statistics: 0.555 (NGPSE); 0.558 (WA); 0.597 (FIRST)). Calibration plots showed good agreement between observed and predicted probabilities in NGPSE at one and three years. Plots for WA and FIRST showed poorer agreement with the model underpredicting risk in WA, and over-predicting in FIRST. This was resolved following model recalibration. The model performs well in independent data especially when recalibrated. It should now be used in clinical practice as it can improve the lives of people with single seizures and early epilepsy by enabling targeted treatment choices and more informed patient counselling.", "labels": []}

{"id": 2531, "text": "Most antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are considered to have effects on mood and to be effective in a number of affective disorders. There are, however, conflicting reports in the literature with respect to the psychotropic properties of AEDs. Many of the studies have a number of methodological problems, and much uncertainty still exists regarding the behavioral and mood effects of AEDs. The aim of this study was to assess, in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of seizure-free patients with epilepsy, the effect of withdrawal of AEDs in patients on monotherapy on measures of mood and behavior. One hundred fifteen subjects who had been seizure-free >2 years on drug monotherapy went through a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Each patient was included for 12 months or until seizure relapse. Behavioral function was assessed with the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory 2 (MMPI-2) at baseline and 7 months after withdrawal. Discontinuation of AEDs resulted, to a greater extent than continued treatment, in a slight improvement in symptoms of depression and irritability. Comparable results were achieved in the subgroup taking carbamazepine.

{"id": 2532, "text": "Adenosine has been proposed to be an endogenous anticonvulsant agent. It inhibits glutamate release from excitatory neurons and neuronal firing. Therefore, adenosine agonists have potential clinical application as antiepileptics. In this double-blind randomized, placebo-controlled trial, we assessed the antiepileptic effect of allopurinol as an adjuvant agent in 38 patients with refractory epilepsy. Thirty eight patients were randomly allocated equally to allopurinol+preexisting antiepileptic (Group A) or placebo+preexisting antiepileptic (Group B) for a 6-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The dose of allopurinol was titrated up to 300 mg/day (100 mg TDS). The dose of preexisting medications was maintained without change over the trial. The effect of allopurinol was evaluated by a reduction in the total number of seizures per month and duration of seizure attacks. Of 38 participants, 32 patients completed the study. There were significant differences between the two groups in terms of reduction in the total number of seizure over the trial. Seizures reduction of >30% in 66%, >50% in 55%, and >60% in 44% of cases in the allopurinol group was achieved after 2 months and persisted during the study. Nevertheless, only during month 4 was there a significant difference between the two groups regarding reduction in seizure duration. In the allopurinol group, two patients had transient rashes, two patients had mild nausea, and two experienced dizziness, but only one patient discontinued the drug due to dizziness. In the placebo group, one patient had rash and one patient had nausea. In addition, no significant hematological or hepatic changes were found during the trial in both groups.

In a post hoc analysis, data from five comparative, double-blind, single-drug studies designed to evaluate the efficacy of treatment of patients with partial seizures with oxcarbazepine versus carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, and valproate for approximately 1 year were pooled to investigate same-patient seizure outcome at 6 and 12 months.

In this longitudinal study, individuals with complicated mild to severe TBIs and their significant others (SO) were evaluated at 1 and 12 months postinjury on the Sickness Impact Profile. Awareness was measured by comparing the level of injury-related problems reported by a person with TBI and their SO. Overall, individuals with TBI did not report fewer difficulties than their SO. In contrast, they frequently reported more injury-related difficulties than their SO. As there is no commonly or universally accepted definition for differential awareness, the magnitude of underreporting and over-reporting problems is presented using four different cutoff scores. A minimum discrepancy is proposed for defining awareness difficulties that is based on the standard error of measurement of the test-retest difference of the measure. Reduced self-awareness was inconsistent across both time and functional domains. These results suggest that reduced self-awareness is not the norm at 1 or 12 months postinjury and highlight the need for a more standardized approach to the measurement and classification of self-awareness.", "labels": [[75, 103, "Patient"], [254, 336, "Patient"]]}

The main objective of this study was to assess the effects of AED withdrawal on cognitive functions, seizure relapse, health-related quality of life (HRQOL), and EEG results. Additionally, potential predictors for freedom from seizures after AED withdrawal were studied. Patients, seizure-free for more than 2 years on AED monotherapy, were recruited for a controlled, prospective, randomized, double-blinded withdrawal study lasting for 12 months, or until seizure relapse. Patients were randomized to AED withdrawal (n = 79) and nonwithdrawal (n = 81) groups. The examination program included clinical neurological examinations, neuropsychological testing, EEG-recordings, cerebral MRI, and assessments of HRQOL. Follow-up data on seizure relapse were also collected beyond the 12-month study period (median 47 months). Seizure relapse at 12 months occurred in 15% of the withdrawal group and 7% of the nonwithdrawal group (RR 2.46; 95% CI: 0.85-7.08; p = 0.095). After withdrawal, seizure relapse rates were 27% after a median of 41 months off medication. A normal result to all 15 neuropsychological tests increased significantly from 11% to 28% postwithdrawal.

Patients with an adequately documented history of two or more clinically definite unprovoked epileptic seizures within the last year for whom treatment with a single antiepileptic drug represented the best therapeutic option. Arm A was carbamazepine (CBZ) versus gabapentin (GBP) versus lamotrigine (LTG) versus oxcarbazepine (OXC) versus topiramate (TPM). Arm B valproate (VPS) versus LTG versus TPM. Time to treatment failure (withdrawal of the randomised drug for reasons of unacceptable adverse events or inadequate seizure control or a combination of the two) and time to achieve a 12-month remission of seizures. Time from randomisation to first seizure, 24-month remission of seizures, incidence of clinically important adverse events, quality of life (QoL) outcomes and health economic outcomes were also considered. Arm A recruited 1721 patients (88% with symptomatic or cryptogenic partial epilepsy and 10% with unclassified epilepsy). Arm B recruited 716 patients (63% with idiopathic generalised epilepsy and 25% with unclassified epilepsy). In Arm A LTG had the lowest incidence of treatment failure and was statistically superior to all drugs for this outcome with the exception of OXC. Some 12% and 8% fewer patients experienced treatment failure on LTG than CBZ, the standard drug, at 1 and 2 years after randomisation, respectively. The superiority of LTG over CBZ was due to its better tolerability but there is satisfactory evidence indicating that LTG is not clinically inferior to CBZ for measures of its efficacy. No consistent differences in QoL outcomes were found between treatment groups. Health economic analysis supported LTG being preferred to CBZ for both cost per seizure avoided and cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained. In Arm B for time to treatment failure, VPS, the standard drug, was preferred to both TPM and LTG, as it was the drug least likely to be associated with treatment failure for inadequate seizure control and was the preferred drug for time to achieving a 12-month remission. QoL assessments did not show any between-treatment differences. The health economic assessment supported the conclusion that VPS should remain the drug of first choice for idiopathic generalised or unclassified epilepsy, although there is a suggestion that TPM is a cost-effective alternative to VPS. The evidence suggests that LTG may be a clinical and cost-effective alternative to the existing standard drug treatment, CBZ, for patients diagnosed as having partial seizures.

Patients with refractory partial epilepsy were enrolled in this double-blind, multicenter, concentration-response trial that evaluated the efficacy and safety of high versus low trough plasma VPA concentrations following administration of divalproex sodium as monotherapy. Trough VPA concentrations and concomitant platelet counts were drawn at baseline and intermittently throughout the 24-week trial. Bivariate correlations and multivariate stepwise regression analysis were performed between platelet counts and multiple variables. A logistic regression analysis was done to determine the probability of developing thrombocytopenia at various VPA levels. A total of 851 VPA levels and concomitant platelet counts were analyzed in 265 patients. Of these, 17.7% of patients experienced at least one episode of thrombocytopenia (platelet count < or = 100,000/microl) after exposure to divalproex sodium. A significant negative correlation was found between VPA levels and platelet counts. Women were significantly more likely to develop thrombocytopenia. The probability of developing thrombocytopenia substantially increased at trough VPA levels above 100 microg/ml in women and above 130 microg/ml in men.

Eligible patients between 4 and 30 years of age had multiple types of seizures (including tonic-atonic and atypical absence seizures) with a minimum of 90 seizures in the month before baseline and a recent history of a slow spike-and-wave pattern on EEG. After a 28-day baseline period, 139 eligible patients were randomized; 138 patients received either rufinamide (n = 74) or placebo (n = 64) in addition to their other antiepileptic drugs. The median percentage reduction in total seizure frequency was greater in the rufinamide therapy group than in the placebo group (32.7% vs 11.7%, p = 0.0015). There was a difference (p < 0.0001) in tonic-atonic (drop attack) seizure frequency with rufinamide (42.5% median percentage reduction) vs placebo (1.4% increase). The rufinamide group had a greater improvement in seizure severity (p = 0.0041) and a higher 50% responder rate compared with placebo for total seizures (p = 0.0045) and tonic-atonic seizures (p = 0.002). The common adverse events (reported by >or=10% of patients receiving rufinamide) were somnolence (24.3% with rufinamide vs 12.5% with placebo) and vomiting (21.6% vs 6.3%).

Enrolment for the trial ran between December, 2001, and July, 2006. Children were seen at one of two hospital centres or a residential centre for young people with epilepsy. Children were randomly assigned to receive a ketogenic diet, either immediately or after a 3-month delay, with no other changes to treatment (control group). Neither the family nor investigators were blinded to the group assignment. Early withdrawals were recorded, and seizure frequency on the diet was assessed after 3 months and compared with that of the controls. The primary endpoint was a reduction in seizures; analysis was intention to treat. Tolerability of the diet was assessed by questionnaire at 3 months. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00564915. 73 children were assigned to the ketogenic diet and 72 children to the control group. Data from 103 children were available for analysis: 54 on the ketogenic diet and 49 controls. Of those who did not complete the trial, 16 children did not receive their intervention, 16 did not provide adequate data, and ten withdrew from the treatment before the 3-month review, six because of intolerance. After 3 months, the mean percentage of baseline seizures was significantly lower in the diet group than in the controls (62.0%vs 136.9%, 75% decrease, 95% CI 42.4-107.4%; p<0.0001). 28 children (38%) in the diet group had greater than 50% seizure reduction compared with four (6%) controls (p<0.0001), and five children (7%) in the diet group had greater than 90% seizure reduction compared with no controls (p=0.0582).

Previous studies have primarily reported minor influence on neuropsychological raw scores, and the clinical relevance of these findings is unclear.

We report outcomes on measures of choice reaction time from the California Computerized Assessment Package, on the Controlled Oral Word Association Test and on the Stroop Color-Word Interference Test. Significantly improved T-scores were revealed after AED withdrawal on five of the six tests of executive functions with mean improvement of 5 T-scores. Comparable results were achieved in the subgroup taking carbamazepine, with a mean improvement of 6.2 T-scores.

Logistic regression modeling was used to assess the influence of sleep, as well as other clinical factors. Although children with sleep-deprived electroencephalograms had less sleep the night before (4.9 vs 7.9 hours) and more sleep during electroencephalograms (73% vs 55%), the increase in electroencephalogram yield was borderline significant (56% normal sleep-deprived electroencephalogram versus 68% normal routine electroencephalogram). Moreover, sleep during the electroencephalogram did not increase its diagnostic yield. Sleep-deprived electroencephalogram yield tended to be higher in children with preelectroencephalogram clinical diagnosis of seizure(s) and at older ages (>3 years). Sleep deprivation, but not sleep during the electroencephalogram, modestly increases the yield of the electroencephalogram in children diagnosed with seizures by neurologists. Compared with a routine electroencephalogram, the number needed to test with sleep-deprived electroencephalogram to identify 1 additional child with epileptiform discharges is approximately 11.", "labels": [[508, 511, "N"], [512, 539, "Patient"], [468, 504, "Intervention"], [163, 185, "Patient"], [372, 380, "Patient"], [431, 460, "Control"], [85, 124, "Control"], [240, 294, "Intervention"], [1786, 1821, "Control"], [0, 32, "Control"], [1249, 1277, "Control"], [944, 1278, "Outcome"], [748, 776, "Control"], [792, 827, "Intervention"], [967, 1003, "Intervention"], [1195, 1230, "Intervention"], [1367, 1402, "Intervention"], [1723, 1753, "Intervention"], [1290, 1365, "Outcome_2nd"], [1367, 1531, "Outcome_2nd"], [1533, 1707, "Outcome"], [1709, 1901, "Outcome_2nd"]]}
