not _ _ O

Surveyed _ _ O

A _ _ O

through _ _ O

Methods: _ _ O
In _ _ O
this _ _ O

40 _ _ O

the _ _ O
skin _ _ O
properties _ _ O
(oily _ _ O

The _ _ O
clinical _ _ O
evaluation _ _ O
of _ _ O

An _ _ O

In _ _ O

However, _ _ O

a _ _ O

in _ _ O

from _ _ O

2020 _ _ O
to _ _ O
August _ _ O
2020. _ _ O
Based _ _ O
on _ _ O
working _ _ O
methods _ _ O
during _ _ O
the _ _ O
pandemic, _ _ O
workers _ _ O
were _ _ O
categorized _ _ O
into _ _ O
the _ _ O
office _ _ B-Control

(n _ _ O

and _ _ O
telework _ _ B-Intervention

(n _ _ O

we _ _ O

The _ _ O

the _ _ O

During _ _ O

teleworkers _ _ O
experienced _ _ O
more _ _ O

67.0% _ _ O

the _ _ O

Approximately _ _ O

they _ _ O

in _ _ O
both _ _ O
working _ _ O

Work-family _ _ O

was _ _ O
more _ _ O
pronounced _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
TT _ _ O

than _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
two _ _ O

Only _ _ O
13.2% _ _ O

did _ _ O
not _ _ O
experience _ _ O
any _ _ O
stress _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O

all _ _ O

In _ _ B-O

The _ _ O

Only _ _ O
1 _ _ O

(p _ _ O

In _ _ O
summary, _ _ O
the _ _ O
efficacy _ _ O
of _ _ O
topiramate _ _ O

was _ _ O
not _ _ O

the _ _ O

Although _ _ O

after _ _ O

As _ _ O

it _ _ O

Hence, _ _ O
the _ _ O

may _ _ O
be _ _ O
a _ _ O

to _ _ O

Conflicting _ _ O
theories _ _ O
have _ _ O
been _ _ O
advanced _ _ O
to _ _ O
explain _ _ O
why _ _ O
hippocampal _ _ O
lesions _ _ O
affect _ _ O
distinct _ _ O

domains _ _ O
and _ _ O
spare _ _ O

Recent _ _ O
findings _ _ O
in _ _ O

suggest _ _ O
that _ _ O

plasticity _ _ O
may _ _ O
contribute _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
seeming _ _ O
preservation _ _ O
of _ _ O
some _ _ O
of _ _ O
these _ _ O

We _ _ O

this _ _ O
hypothesis _ _ O

in _ _ O

significant _ _ O

deficit _ _ O
in _ _ O

No _ _ O
such _ _ O
deficit _ _ O
was _ _ O
observed _ _ O
in _ _ O
hippocampal _ _ O

patients, _ _ O
which _ _ O
appeared _ _ O
to _ _ O
benefit _ _ O
from _ _ O
a _ _ O
compensatory _ _ O
mechanism _ _ O
that _ _ O
was _ _ O
inefficient _ _ O
in _ _ O

These _ _ O
results _ _ O
indicate _ _ O
that _ _ O
long-standing _ _ O

significant _ _ O

some _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O

Adenosine _ _ O
has _ _ O
been _ _ O
proposed _ _ O
to _ _ O

an _ _ O

It _ _ O
inhibits _ _ O

Therefore, _ _ O

In _ _ O
