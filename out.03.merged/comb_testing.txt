Consequently, _ _ O

Following _ _ O
randomization _ _ O
of _ _ O

the _ _ O

terminated _ _ O
due _ _ O
to _ _ O

was _ _ O
detected _ _ O
in _ _ O
18 _ _ O

(29.0%), _ _ O

it _ _ O

more _ _ O

Takotsubo _ _ O
Syndrome(TTS), _ _ O
contrary _ _ O
to _ _ O
historical _ _ O
reports, _ _ O
is _ _ O
now _ _ O
increasingly _ _ O
recognised _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O

with _ _ O
substantial _ _ O
mortality _ _ O
and _ _ O
morbidity, _ _ O
both _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
short- _ _ O

long-term. _ _ O
Although _ _ O
TTS _ _ O
is _ _ O
often _ _ O
precipitated _ _ O
by _ _ O
a _ _ O
catecholamine _ _ O
pulse, _ _ O
in-hospital _ _ O
hypotension _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
common _ _ O
occurrence, _ _ O
increasing _ _ O
the _ _ O
risk _ _ O
of _ _ O
mortality. _ _ O
Furthermore, _ _ O
despite _ _ O
the _ _ O
transient _ _ O
catecholamine _ _ O
stimulus, _ _ O
there _ _ O
is _ _ O
increasing _ _ O
evidence _ _ O
that _ _ O
there _ _ O
are _ _ O

to _ _ O
limit _ _ O
the _ _ O
extent _ _ O
of _ _ O
initial _ _ O
myocardial _ _ O
injury, _ _ O
and _ _ O
to _ _ O
accelerate _ _ O
recovery _ _ O
in _ _ O
TTS _ _ O
is _ _ O
therefore _ _ O
justified. _ _ O
However _ _ O
to _ _ O

there _ _ O
has _ _ O

a _ _ O

The _ _ O
rationale _ _ O
for _ _ O

agents _ _ O
is _ _ O
related _ _ O
to _ _ O
their _ _ O

A _ _ O

Gefitinib _ _ O
and _ _ O
erlotinib _ _ O
are _ _ O

for _ _ O

patients _ _ O
with _ _ O

However, _ _ O

of _ _ O
epidermal _ _ O
growth _ _ O
factor _ _ O
receptor-tyrosine _ _ O

inhibitors _ _ O
in _ _ O
older _ _ O
patients _ _ O
is _ _ O
difficult, _ _ O
owing _ _ O
to _ _ O
potential _ _ O
adverse _ _ O
events. _ _ O
Hence, _ _ O
dose _ _ O
reduction _ _ O
or _ _ O
treatment _ _ O
discontinuation _ _ O
is _ _ O
often _ _ O
required. _ _ O
We _ _ O
investigated _ _ O
the _ _ O
efficacy _ _ B-Outcome
of _ _ O
low-dose _ _ O
first-line _ _ O
erlotinib _ _ O
and _ _ O
its _ _ O
effects _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
quality _ _ O

A _ _ O

with _ _ O
epidermal _ _ O
growth _ _ O

receptor-mutant _ _ O
non-small _ _ O

lung _ _ O
cancer. _ _ O
Initially, _ _ O
100 _ _ O
mg/day _ _ O
erlotinib _ _ O
was _ _ O
administered _ _ O
orally; _ _ O
if _ _ O
well _ _ O
tolerated, _ _ O
it _ _ O
was _ _ O
increased _ _ O
to _ _ O
150 _ _ O
mg/day. _ _ O
The _ _ O
primary _ _ O
end-point _ _ O
was _ _ O
progression-free _ _ O
survival, _ _ O
and _ _ O
secondary _ _ O
end-points _ _ O
were _ _ O
the _ _ O

overall _ _ O
survival _ _ O
and _ _ O
change _ _ O
in _ _ O
quality _ _ O
of _ _ O
life _ _ O
(Care _ _ O

The _ _ O
median _ _ O
progression-free _ _ O
survival _ _ O
was _ _ O
17.8 _ _ O
months, _ _ O
response _ _ O
rate _ _ O
was _ _ O
63.6% _ _ O
and _ _ O
median _ _ O
overall _ _ O
survival _ _ O
was _ _ O
27.8 _ _ O

The _ _ O
change _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
quality _ _ O
of _ _ O
life _ _ O
after _ _ O
6 _ _ O
weeks _ _ O
was _ _ O
assessed _ _ O
in _ _ O
72.7% _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
patients. _ _ O
Fatigue, _ _ O
pain, _ _ O

and _ _ O

in _ _ O

activities _ _ O
were _ _ O
found _ _ O
in _ _ O
at _ _ O
least _ _ O
40% _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
patients. _ _ O
Despite _ _ O
the _ _ O
therapeutic _ _ O
effect _ _ O
of _ _ O
100 _ _ O
mg/day _ _ O
erlotinib, _ _ O
many _ _ O
patients _ _ O
required _ _ O
dose _ _ O
reduction, _ _ O
and _ _ O
in _ _ O
some, _ _ O
the _ _ O
quality _ _ O

could _ _ O

not _ _ O

with _ _ O
any _ _ O

This _ _ O

that _ _ O
the _ _ O

prediction _ _ O
of _ _ O

risk _ _ O
in _ _ O

the _ _ O

In _ _ O
patients _ _ B-Patient
with _ _ I-Patient
epilepsy, _ _ I-Patient
poor _ _ O
adherence _ _ O
to _ _ O
anti-epileptic _ _ O
drugs _ _ O
has _ _ O
been _ _ O
shown _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
the _ _ O
most _ _ O
important _ _ O
cause _ _ O
of _ _ O
poorly _ _ O
controlled _ _ O
epilepsy. _ _ O
Furthermore, _ _ O
it _ _ O
has _ _ O
been _ _ O
noted _ _ O
that _ _ O
the _ _ O
quality _ _ O
of _ _ O
life _ _ O
among _ _ O
patients _ _ B-Patient
with _ _ I-Patient
epilepsy _ _ I-Patient
can _ _ O
be _ _ O
improved _ _ O
by _ _ O
counseling _ _ O
and _ _ O
treatments _ _ O
aimed _ _ O
at _ _ O
increasing _ _ O
their _ _ O
self-efficacy _ _ O
and _ _ O
concordance, _ _ O
thus _ _ O
stimulating _ _ O
self-management _ _ O
skills. _ _ O
However, _ _ O
there _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
need _ _ O
for _ _ O
evidence _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
effectiveness _ _ O
of _ _ O
such _ _ O
programs, _ _ O
especially _ _ O
within _ _ O
epilepsy _ _ O
care. _ _ O
Therefore, _ _ O
we _ _ O
have _ _ O
developed _ _ O
a _ _ B-Intervention
multi-component _ _ I-Intervention
intervention _ _ I-Intervention
(MCI) _ _ I-Intervention
which _ _ I-Intervention
combines _ _ I-Intervention
a _ _ I-Intervention
self-management/education _ _ I-Intervention
program _ _ I-Intervention
with _ _ I-Intervention
e-Health _ _ I-Intervention
interventions. _ _ I-Intervention
Accordingly, _ _ O
the _ _ O
overall _ _ O
objective _ _ O
of _ _ O
this _ _ O
study _ _ O
is _ _ O
to _ _ O
assess _ _ O
the _ _ O
(cost)-effectiveness _ _ O
and _ _ O
feasibility _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ B-Intervention
MCI, _ _ I-Intervention
aiming _ _ O
to _ _ O
improve _ _ O
self-efficacy _ _ O
and _ _ O
concordance _ _ O
in _ _ O
patients _ _ B-Patient
with _ _ I-Patient
epilepsy. _ _ I-Patient
A _ _ O
RCT _ _ O
in _ _ O
two _ _ O

will _ _ O
be _ _ O

the _ _ B-Intervention

with _ _ O
a _ _ B-Control

in _ _ O
epilepsy _ _ B-Patient

One _ _ O

will _ _ O
be _ _ O

and _ _ O

to _ _ O
either _ _ O
the _ _ O

The _ _ B-Intervention

of _ _ I-Intervention
a _ _ I-Intervention
self-management/education _ _ I-Intervention
program _ _ I-Intervention
of _ _ I-Intervention
six _ _ I-Intervention
meetings, _ _ I-Intervention
including _ _ I-Intervention
e-Health _ _ I-Intervention
interventions, _ _ I-Intervention
and _ _ I-Intervention
will _ _ I-Intervention
be _ _ I-Intervention
followed _ _ I-Intervention
for _ _ I-Intervention
12 _ _ I-Intervention
months. _ _ I-Intervention
The _ _ B-Control
control _ _ I-Control
group _ _ I-Control
will _ _ I-Control
receive _ _ I-Control
care _ _ I-Control
as _ _ I-Control
usual _ _ I-Control
and _ _ I-Control
will _ _ I-Control
be _ _ I-Control
followed _ _ I-Control
for _ _ I-Control
6 _ _ I-Control

after _ _ O
which _ _ O
patients _ _ O
will _ _ O
be _ _ O
offered _ _ O
the _ _ O
possibility _ _ O
of _ _ O
participating _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
MCI. _ _ O
The _ _ O
study _ _ O
will _ _ O
consist _ _ O
of _ _ O
three _ _ O
parts: _ _ O
1) _ _ O
a _ _ O
clinical _ _ O
effectiveness _ _ O
study, _ _ O
2) _ _ O
a _ _ O
cost-effectiveness _ _ O
study, _ _ O
and _ _ O
3) _ _ O
process _ _ O
evaluation. _ _ O
The _ _ O
primary _ _ O
outcome _ _ O
will _ _ O
be _ _ O
self-efficacy. _ _ O
Secondary _ _ O
outcomes _ _ O
include _ _ O
adherence, _ _ O
side _ _ O
effects, _ _ O
change _ _ O
in _ _ O
seizure _ _ O
severity _ _ O
& _ _ O
frequency, _ _ O
improved _ _ O
quality _ _ O
of _ _ O
life, _ _ O
proactive _ _ O
coping, _ _ O
and _ _ O
societal _ _ O
costs. _ _ O
Outcome _ _ O
assessments _ _ O
will _ _ O
be _ _ O
done _ _ O
using _ _ O
questionnaires _ _ O
at _ _ O
baseline _ _ O
and _ _ O
after _ _ O
3, _ _ O
6, _ _ O
9, _ _ O
and _ _ O
12 _ _ O
months _ _ O
(last _ _ O
two _ _ O
applicable _ _ O
only _ _ O
for _ _ O
intervention _ _ O
group). _ _ O
In _ _ O
times _ _ O
of _ _ O
budget _ _ O
constraints, _ _ O
MCI _ _ O
could _ _ O
be _ _ O
a _ _ O
valuable _ _ O
addition _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
current _ _ O
healthcare _ _ O
provision _ _ O
for _ _ O
epilepsy, _ _ O
as _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
expected _ _ O
that _ _ O
higher _ _ O
concordance _ _ O
and _ _ O
self-efficacy _ _ O
will _ _ O
result _ _ O
in _ _ O
reduced _ _ O
use _ _ O
of _ _ O
healthcare _ _ O
resources _ _ O
and _ _ O
an _ _ O
increased _ _ O
QOL. _ _ O
Accordingly, _ _ O
this _ _ O
study _ _ O
is _ _ O
aimed _ _ O
helping _ _ O
patients _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
their _ _ O
own _ _ O

of _ _ O
health _ _ O
care, _ _ O
shifting _ _ O

some _ _ O

of _ _ O
living _ _ O
with _ _ O
epilepsy _ _ O
by _ _ O
thematically _ _ O
analyzing _ _ O
participants' _ _ O
written _ _ O
accounts _ _ O
of _ _ O
their _ _ O
condition. _ _ O
Writing _ _ O
is _ _ O
seen _ _ O
as _ _ O
an _ _ O
individual _ _ O
act _ _ O
allowing _ _ O
for _ _ O
private _ _ O
exploration, _ _ O
reflection _ _ O
and _ _ O
expression _ _ O
of _ _ O
thoughts _ _ O
and _ _ O
feelings. _ _ O
Participants _ _ O
(n=20) _ _ O
were _ _ O
recruited _ _ O
from _ _ O
a _ _ O
United _ _ B-Patient
Kingdom _ _ I-Patient
hospital _ _ O
and _ _ O
from _ _ O
membership-led _ _ O

for _ _ O
individuals _ _ B-Patient
living _ _ I-Patient

Participants _ _ O
were _ _ O
asked _ _ O
to _ _ O
produce _ _ O
four _ _ O
pieces _ _ O
of _ _ O
writing: _ _ O
1) _ _ O
about _ _ O
their _ _ O
thoughts _ _ O

about _ _ O
their _ _ O
condition; _ _ O
2) _ _ O
a _ _ O

3) _ _ O
a _ _ O

to _ _ O
their _ _ O

4) _ _ O
about _ _ O
a _ _ O

approach. _ _ O
Five _ _ O
main-themes _ _ O
and _ _ O
22 _ _ O
sub-themes _ _ O
emerged _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
data. _ _ O
Theme _ _ O
1: _ _ O
'seizure _ _ O
onset' _ _ O
demonstrated _ _ O
that _ _ O
the _ _ O
development _ _ O
of _ _ O
seizures _ _ O
and _ _ O
subsequent _ _ O
diagnosis _ _ O
was _ _ O
an _ _ O
important _ _ O
event _ _ O
that _ _ O
could _ _ O
change _ _ O
an _ _ O
individuals' _ _ O
identity. _ _ O
Theme _ _ O
2: _ _ O
'seizure _ _ O
symptoms' _ _ O
revealed _ _ O
participants _ _ O
externalized _ _ O
their _ _ O
seizures _ _ O
as _ _ O
an _ _ O
intrusive _ _ O
agent _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
constant _ _ O
presence _ _ O
in _ _ O
their _ _ O
lives. _ _ O
Theme _ _ O
3: _ _ O
'treatment _ _ O
and _ _ O
outcome' _ _ O
reflected _ _ O
medication _ _ O
as _ _ O
an _ _ O
essential _ _ O
means _ _ O
to _ _ O
controlling _ _ O
seizures _ _ O
with _ _ O
subsequent _ _ O
side _ _ O
effects _ _ O
being _ _ O
perceived _ _ O
as _ _ O
a _ _ O
compromise. _ _ O
Theme _ _ O
4: _ _ O
'living _ _ O
with _ _ O
epilepsy' _ _ O
explored _ _ O
the _ _ O
consequences _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
condition _ _ O
including _ _ O
restrictions _ _ O
and _ _ O
stigma. _ _ O
Theme _ _ O
5: _ _ O
'displays _ _ O
of _ _ O
coping' _ _ O
demonstrated _ _ O
that, _ _ O
for _ _ O
the _ _ O
most _ _ O
part, _ _ O
participants _ _ O
were _ _ O
keen _ _ O
to _ _ O
present _ _ O
themselves _ _ O
as _ _ O
living _ _ O
well _ _ O
with _ _ O
epilepsy. _ _ O
The _ _ O
results _ _ O
add _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
growing _ _ O
research _ _ O
applying _ _ O
qualitative _ _ O
methodologies _ _ O
to _ _ O
investigate _ _ O
the _ _ O
phenomenology _ _ O
of _ _ O
epilepsy. _ _ O
Qualitative _ _ O
research _ _ O
can _ _ O
improve _ _ O
our _ _ O
understanding _ _ O
and _ _ O
awareness _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
condition, _ _ O
as _ _ O
well _ _ O

The _ _ O

In _ _ O
