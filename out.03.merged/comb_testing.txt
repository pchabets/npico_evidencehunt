a _ _ O

Recent _ _ O

that _ _ O
lacosamide, _ _ O
which _ _ O
blocks _ _ O
sodium _ _ O

a _ _ O

manner, _ _ O
attenuates _ _ O

however, _ _ O
only _ _ O
a _ _ O
subgroup _ _ O
of _ _ O
these _ _ O

responded _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O

that _ _ O

selection _ _ O
criteria _ _ O
to _ _ O
identify _ _ O

The _ _ O

In _ _ O

identified _ _ O
ICs _ _ O
were _ _ O

with _ _ O
presurgical _ _ O
evaluation _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
remaining _ _ O
one _ _ O

In _ _ O
the _ _ O

successfully _ _ O
rejected _ _ O
all _ _ O

of _ _ O
seven _ _ O
subjects _ _ O
as _ _ O
non-epilepsy _ _ O
related _ _ O
components. _ _ O
These _ _ O
results _ _ O
suggest _ _ O
the _ _ O
lateralization _ _ O
and _ _ O
localization _ _ O
value _ _ O
of _ _ O

alone _ _ O
in _ _ O
presurgical _ _ O

was _ _ O

in _ _ O
110 _ _ O
responders _ _ O
(77%, _ _ O

There _ _ O
was _ _ O
no _ _ O
significant _ _ O

in _ _ O

in _ _ O
the _ _ O
prognostic _ _ O
model _ _ O
between _ _ O
responders _ _ O
with _ _ O

without _ _ O
epilepsy _ _ O
at _ _ O
follow-up. _ _ O
Those _ _ O
with _ _ O
active _ _ O
epilepsy _ _ O
were _ _ O
unemployed _ _ O
significantly _ _ O
more _ _ O
often _ _ O
and _ _ O
perceived _ _ O
their _ _ O
mental _ _ O
health _ _ O
significantly _ _ O
more _ _ O
affected _ _ O
than _ _ O
those _ _ O
seizure-free _ _ O
without _ _ O
treatment. _ _ O
Duration _ _ O
of _ _ O

ASM _ _ O
treatment _ _ O
was _ _ O
not _ _ O
associated _ _ O
with _ _ O
any _ _ O
difference _ _ O
in _ _ O
subsequent _ _ O
epilepsy _ _ O
risk. _ _ O
This _ _ O
indicates _ _ O
that _ _ O
the _ _ O
timing _ _ O
of _ _ O
withdrawal _ _ O
attempts _ _ O
is _ _ O
unlikely _ _ O
to _ _ O
alter _ _ O
the _ _ O
long-term _ _ O
prognosis _ _ O
of _ _ O

The _ _ O

the _ _ O
prognostic _ _ O
model _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
initial _ _ O
study _ _ O
to _ _ O
predict _ _ O
long-term _ _ O
outcome _ _ O
argues _ _ O
that _ _ O
although _ _ O
prediction _ _ O
of _ _ O
relapse _ _ O
risk _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
shorter _ _ O
term _ _ O
may _ _ O
be _ _ O
possible, _ _ O
the _ _ O
bearing _ _ O
of _ _ O
such _ _ O
models _ _ O
on _ _ O
long-term _ _ O

is _ _ O
more _ _ O

among _ _ O
patients _ _ B-Patient
with _ _ I-Patient
epilepsy _ _ I-Patient
can _ _ O
be _ _ O
improved _ _ O
by _ _ O
counseling _ _ O
and _ _ O
treatments _ _ O
aimed _ _ O
at _ _ O
increasing _ _ O
their _ _ O
self-efficacy _ _ O
and _ _ O
concordance, _ _ O
thus _ _ O
stimulating _ _ O
self-management _ _ O
skills. _ _ O
However, _ _ O
there _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
need _ _ O
for _ _ O
evidence _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
effectiveness _ _ O
of _ _ O
such _ _ O
programs, _ _ O
especially _ _ O
within _ _ O
epilepsy _ _ O
care. _ _ O
Therefore, _ _ O
we _ _ O
have _ _ O
developed _ _ O
a _ _ B-Intervention
multi-component _ _ I-Intervention
intervention _ _ I-Intervention
(MCI) _ _ I-Intervention
which _ _ I-Intervention
combines _ _ I-Intervention
a _ _ I-Intervention
self-management/education _ _ I-Intervention
program _ _ I-Intervention
with _ _ I-Intervention
e-Health _ _ I-Intervention
interventions. _ _ I-Intervention
Accordingly, _ _ O
the _ _ O
overall _ _ O
objective _ _ O
of _ _ O
this _ _ O
study _ _ O
is _ _ O
to _ _ O
assess _ _ O
the _ _ O
(cost)-effectiveness _ _ O
and _ _ O
feasibility _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ B-Intervention
MCI, _ _ I-Intervention
aiming _ _ O
to _ _ O
improve _ _ O
self-efficacy _ _ O
and _ _ O
concordance _ _ O
in _ _ O
patients _ _ B-Patient
with _ _ I-Patient
epilepsy. _ _ I-Patient
A _ _ O
RCT _ _ O
in _ _ O
two _ _ O
parallel _ _ O
groups _ _ O
will _ _ O
be _ _ O
conducted _ _ O
to _ _ O
compare _ _ O
the _ _ B-Intervention
MCI _ _ I-Intervention
with _ _ O
a _ _ B-Control
control _ _ I-Control
condition _ _ I-Control
in _ _ O
epilepsy _ _ B-Patient
patients. _ _ I-Patient
One _ _ O
hundred _ _ O
eligible _ _ O
epilepsy _ _ B-Patient
patients _ _ I-Patient
will _ _ O
be _ _ O
recruited _ _ O
and _ _ O
allocated _ _ O
to _ _ O
either _ _ O
the _ _ O

or _ _ O

group. _ _ I-Control
The _ _ B-Intervention

will _ _ I-Intervention
receive _ _ I-Intervention
the _ _ I-Intervention
MCI _ _ I-Intervention
consisting _ _ I-Intervention
of _ _ I-Intervention
a _ _ I-Intervention

program _ _ I-Intervention
of _ _ I-Intervention
six _ _ I-Intervention
meetings, _ _ I-Intervention
including _ _ I-Intervention
e-Health _ _ I-Intervention
interventions, _ _ I-Intervention
and _ _ I-Intervention
will _ _ I-Intervention
be _ _ I-Intervention
followed _ _ I-Intervention
for _ _ I-Intervention
12 _ _ I-Intervention
months. _ _ I-Intervention
The _ _ B-Control

group _ _ I-Control
will _ _ I-Control
receive _ _ I-Control
care _ _ I-Control
as _ _ I-Control
usual _ _ I-Control
and _ _ I-Control
will _ _ I-Control
be _ _ I-Control
followed _ _ I-Control
for _ _ I-Control
6 _ _ I-Control

after _ _ O
which _ _ O
patients _ _ O
will _ _ O
be _ _ O
offered _ _ O
the _ _ O
possibility _ _ O
of _ _ O
participating _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
MCI. _ _ O
The _ _ O
study _ _ O
will _ _ O
consist _ _ O
of _ _ O
three _ _ O
parts: _ _ O
1) _ _ O
a _ _ O
clinical _ _ O
effectiveness _ _ O
study, _ _ O
2) _ _ O
a _ _ O
cost-effectiveness _ _ O
study, _ _ O
and _ _ O
3) _ _ O
process _ _ O
evaluation. _ _ O
The _ _ O
primary _ _ O
outcome _ _ O
will _ _ O
be _ _ O
self-efficacy. _ _ O
Secondary _ _ O
outcomes _ _ O
include _ _ O
adherence, _ _ O
side _ _ O
effects, _ _ O
change _ _ O
in _ _ O
seizure _ _ O
severity _ _ O
& _ _ O
frequency, _ _ O
improved _ _ O
quality _ _ O
of _ _ O
life, _ _ O
proactive _ _ O
coping, _ _ O
and _ _ O
societal _ _ O
costs. _ _ O
Outcome _ _ O
assessments _ _ O
will _ _ O
be _ _ O
done _ _ O
using _ _ O
questionnaires _ _ O
at _ _ O
baseline _ _ O
and _ _ O
after _ _ O
3, _ _ O
6, _ _ O
9, _ _ O
and _ _ O
12 _ _ O
months _ _ O
(last _ _ O
two _ _ O
applicable _ _ O
only _ _ O
for _ _ O
intervention _ _ O
group). _ _ O
In _ _ O
times _ _ O
of _ _ O
budget _ _ O
constraints, _ _ O
MCI _ _ O
could _ _ O
be _ _ O
a _ _ O
valuable _ _ O
addition _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
current _ _ O
healthcare _ _ O
provision _ _ O
for _ _ O
epilepsy, _ _ O
as _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
expected _ _ O
that _ _ O
higher _ _ O
concordance _ _ O
and _ _ O
self-efficacy _ _ O
will _ _ O
result _ _ O
in _ _ O
reduced _ _ O
use _ _ O
of _ _ O
healthcare _ _ O
resources _ _ O
and _ _ O
an _ _ O
increased _ _ O
QOL. _ _ O
Accordingly, _ _ O
this _ _ O
study _ _ O
is _ _ O
aimed _ _ O
helping _ _ O
patients _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
their _ _ O
own _ _ O

of _ _ O
health _ _ O

examines _ _ O
the _ _ O
subjective _ _ O
experience _ _ O
of _ _ O
living _ _ O
with _ _ O
epilepsy _ _ O
by _ _ O
thematically _ _ O
analyzing _ _ O
participants' _ _ O
written _ _ O
accounts _ _ O
of _ _ O
their _ _ O
condition. _ _ O
Writing _ _ O
is _ _ O
seen _ _ O
as _ _ O
an _ _ O
individual _ _ O
act _ _ O
allowing _ _ O
for _ _ O
private _ _ O
exploration, _ _ O
reflection _ _ O
and _ _ O
expression _ _ O
of _ _ O
thoughts _ _ O
and _ _ O
feelings. _ _ O
Participants _ _ O
(n=20) _ _ O
were _ _ O
recruited _ _ O
from _ _ O
a _ _ O
United _ _ B-Patient
Kingdom _ _ I-Patient
hospital _ _ O
and _ _ O
from _ _ O
membership-led _ _ O
organizations _ _ O
for _ _ O
individuals _ _ B-Patient
living _ _ I-Patient
with _ _ I-Patient
seizures. _ _ I-Patient
Participants _ _ O
were _ _ O
asked _ _ O
to _ _ O
produce _ _ O
four _ _ O
pieces _ _ O
of _ _ O
writing: _ _ O
1) _ _ O
about _ _ O
their _ _ O
thoughts _ _ O

about _ _ O
their _ _ O
condition; _ _ O
2) _ _ O
a _ _ O

condition; _ _ O
3) _ _ O
a _ _ O
letter _ _ O
to _ _ O
their _ _ O

4) _ _ O
about _ _ O

Five _ _ O
main-themes _ _ O
and _ _ O
22 _ _ O
sub-themes _ _ O
emerged _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
data. _ _ O
Theme _ _ O
1: _ _ O
'seizure _ _ O
onset' _ _ O
demonstrated _ _ O
that _ _ O
the _ _ O
development _ _ O
of _ _ O
seizures _ _ O
and _ _ O
subsequent _ _ O
diagnosis _ _ O
was _ _ O
an _ _ O
important _ _ O
event _ _ O
that _ _ O
could _ _ O
change _ _ O
an _ _ O
individuals' _ _ O
identity. _ _ O
Theme _ _ O
2: _ _ O
'seizure _ _ O
symptoms' _ _ O
revealed _ _ O
participants _ _ O
externalized _ _ O
their _ _ O
seizures _ _ O
as _ _ O
an _ _ O
intrusive _ _ O
agent _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
constant _ _ O
presence _ _ O
in _ _ O
their _ _ O
lives. _ _ O
Theme _ _ O
3: _ _ O
'treatment _ _ O
and _ _ O
outcome' _ _ O
reflected _ _ O
medication _ _ O
as _ _ O
an _ _ O
essential _ _ O
means _ _ O
to _ _ O
controlling _ _ O
seizures _ _ O
with _ _ O
subsequent _ _ O
side _ _ O
effects _ _ O
being _ _ O
perceived _ _ O
as _ _ O
a _ _ O
compromise. _ _ O
Theme _ _ O
4: _ _ O
'living _ _ O
with _ _ O
epilepsy' _ _ O
explored _ _ O
the _ _ O
consequences _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
condition _ _ O
including _ _ O
restrictions _ _ O
and _ _ O
stigma. _ _ O
Theme _ _ O
5: _ _ O
'displays _ _ O
of _ _ O
coping' _ _ O
demonstrated _ _ O
that, _ _ O
for _ _ O
the _ _ O
most _ _ O
part, _ _ O
participants _ _ O
were _ _ O
keen _ _ O
to _ _ O
present _ _ O
themselves _ _ O
as _ _ O
living _ _ O
well _ _ O
with _ _ O
epilepsy. _ _ O
The _ _ O
results _ _ O
add _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
growing _ _ O
research _ _ O
applying _ _ O
qualitative _ _ O
methodologies _ _ O
to _ _ O
investigate _ _ O
the _ _ O
phenomenology _ _ O
of _ _ O
epilepsy. _ _ O
Qualitative _ _ O
research _ _ O
can _ _ O
improve _ _ O
our _ _ O
understanding _ _ O
and _ _ O
awareness _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
condition, _ _ O
as _ _ O
well _ _ O
as _ _ O
