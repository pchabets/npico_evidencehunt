tensor _ _ O
imaging-based _ _ O
deterministic _ _ O
fibre-tracking _ _ O
of _ _ O

VFD. _ _ O
The _ _ O

Three _ _ O
patients _ _ O
(13 _ _ O

five _ _ O

Although _ _ O

the _ _ O

a _ _ O

DTI-based _ _ O
tracking _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O

a _ _ O

distance _ _ O
of _ _ O

radiation _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O

Temporobasal _ _ O

However, _ _ O

the _ _ O

Secondary _ _ O

that _ _ O
the _ _ O

Conflicting _ _ O
theories _ _ O
have _ _ O
been _ _ O
advanced _ _ O
to _ _ O
explain _ _ O
why _ _ O
hippocampal _ _ O
lesions _ _ O
affect _ _ O
distinct _ _ O
memory _ _ O
domains _ _ O
and _ _ O
spare _ _ O
others. _ _ O
Recent _ _ O
findings _ _ O
in _ _ O

that _ _ O

plasticity _ _ O
may _ _ O
contribute _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O

preservation _ _ O
of _ _ O
some _ _ O
of _ _ O
these _ _ O

this _ _ O

Compared _ _ O

a _ _ O
significant _ _ O
delay-dependent _ _ O
deficit _ _ O
in _ _ O

associations. _ _ O
No _ _ O
such _ _ O
deficit _ _ O
was _ _ O
observed _ _ O
in _ _ O
hippocampal _ _ O

patients, _ _ O
which _ _ O
appeared _ _ O
to _ _ O
benefit _ _ O
from _ _ O
a _ _ O
compensatory _ _ O
mechanism _ _ O
that _ _ O
was _ _ O
inefficient _ _ O
in _ _ O

These _ _ O
results _ _ O
indicate _ _ O
that _ _ O
long-standing _ _ O

damage _ _ O
can _ _ O

significant _ _ O
