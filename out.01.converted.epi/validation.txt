Lacosamide _ _ O
(LCM) _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O
new _ _ O

antiepileptic _ _ O
drug. _ _ O
It _ _ O
has _ _ O
only _ _ O
been _ _ O
available _ _ O
in _ _ O
Asia _ _ O
in _ _ O
recent _ _ O
years. _ _ O
A _ _ O
retrospective _ _ O
study _ _ O
at _ _ O
two _ _ O
hospitals _ _ O
in _ _ O
Hong _ _ O
Kong _ _ O
was _ _ O
performed _ _ O
to _ _ O
investigate _ _ O
the _ _ O
post-marketing _ _ O
efficacy _ _ O
and _ _ O
tolerability _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
drug. _ _ O
A _ _ O
total _ _ O
of _ _ O
81 _ _ O
subjects _ _ O
were _ _ O
recruited, _ _ O
among _ _ O
which _ _ O
88% _ _ O
had _ _ O
drug-resistant _ _ O
epilepsy. _ _ O
The _ _ O
most _ _ O
common _ _ O
type _ _ O
of _ _ O
epilepsy _ _ O
was _ _ O
focal _ _ O
with _ _ O
unknown _ _ O
etiology. _ _ O
All _ _ O
patients _ _ O
used _ _ O
LCM _ _ O
as _ _ O
adjunctive _ _ O
therapy. _ _ O
The _ _ O
50% _ _ O
responder _ _ O
rate _ _ O
was _ _ O
42% _ _ O
at _ _ O
12 _ _ O
weeks _ _ O
after _ _ O
achievement _ _ O
of _ _ O
maximal _ _ O
dose _ _ O
of _ _ O
LCM. _ _ O
No _ _ O
specific _ _ O
factor _ _ O
correlated _ _ O
with _ _ O
responsiveness _ _ O
including _ _ O
concomitant _ _ O
enzyme-inducing _ _ O
or _ _ O
sodium _ _ O
channel _ _ O
blocking _ _ O
anticonvulsants. _ _ O
Withdrawal _ _ O
rate _ _ O
within _ _ O
first _ _ O
12 _ _ O
weeks _ _ O
after _ _ O
drug _ _ O
initiation _ _ O
was _ _ O
14% _ _ O
while _ _ O
that _ _ O
at _ _ O
any _ _ O
time _ _ O
upon _ _ O
follow-up _ _ O
was _ _ O
23%. _ _ O
Two _ _ O
cases _ _ O
of _ _ O
uncommon _ _ O
adverse _ _ O
reaction _ _ O
of _ _ O
myoclonus _ _ O
were _ _ O
also _ _ O
reported. _ _ O
The _ _ O
mechanism _ _ O
was _ _ O
postulated _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
the _ _ O
sodium _ _ O
channel _ _ O
inhibiting _ _ O
action _ _ O
of _ _ O
LCM. _ _ O
Our _ _ O
study _ _ O
has _ _ O
shown _ _ O
LCM _ _ O
to _ _ O

comparable _ _ O
efficacy _ _ O

tolerability _ _ O
in _ _ O

The _ _ O

between _ _ O

Those _ _ O

not _ _ O

any _ _ O

in _ _ O

This _ _ O

(VNS) _ _ I-Intervention
in _ _ O

epilepsy _ _ O
is _ _ O
not _ _ O
entirely _ _ O
clarified. _ _ O
It _ _ O
is _ _ O
believed _ _ O
that _ _ O
VNS _ _ O
causes _ _ O
alterations _ _ O
in _ _ O

which _ _ O
can _ _ O
lead _ _ O
to _ _ O
rebalancing _ _ O
the _ _ O

Forty-one _ _ O

After _ _ O

period _ _ O
of _ _ O
12 _ _ O
weeks, _ _ O
all _ _ O
children _ _ O
underwent _ _ O
implantation _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O

nerve _ _ O
stimulator _ _ O
and _ _ O
entered _ _ O
a _ _ O

phase _ _ O
of _ _ O
20 _ _ O
weeks. _ _ O
Half _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O

received _ _ O
high-output _ _ O
(therapeutic) _ _ O
stimulation _ _ O
(n=21), _ _ O
while _ _ O
the _ _ O
other _ _ O
half _ _ O
received _ _ O
low-output _ _ O
(active _ _ O

stimulation _ _ O
(n=20). _ _ O
Subsequently, _ _ O
all _ _ O
children _ _ O
received _ _ O
high-output _ _ O
stimulation _ _ O
for _ _ O
another _ _ O
19 _ _ O

(add-on _ _ O

Tryptophan _ _ O

by _ _ O
use _ _ O

Regarding _ _ O
tryptophan _ _ O

were _ _ O
significantly _ _ O

at _ _ O
the _ _ O

of _ _ O
the _ _ O
add-on _ _ O
phase _ _ O
compared _ _ O

(p=0.002) _ _ O

correlated _ _ O
significantly _ _ O
with _ _ O

and _ _ O

(τ=-0.33, _ _ O

No _ _ O

were _ _ O

regarding _ _ O

at _ _ O

Although _ _ O
no _ _ O

after _ _ O

As _ _ O
rules _ _ O

it _ _ O
has _ _ O

the _ _ O

Hence, _ _ O
the _ _ O
MCI _ _ O
may _ _ O
be _ _ O
a _ _ O
cost-effective _ _ O
addition _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
