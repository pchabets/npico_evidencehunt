of _ _ O

selection _ _ O
criteria _ _ O
to _ _ O
identify _ _ O

The _ _ O

the _ _ O

In _ _ O

identified _ _ O
ICs _ _ O
were _ _ O

with _ _ O
presurgical _ _ O
evaluation _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
remaining _ _ O
one _ _ O

without _ _ O

features _ _ O
as _ _ O

In _ _ O
the _ _ O

successfully _ _ O
rejected _ _ O
all _ _ O
components _ _ O
in _ _ O
four _ _ O
out _ _ O
of _ _ O
seven _ _ O
subjects _ _ O
as _ _ O
non-epilepsy _ _ O
related _ _ O
components. _ _ O
These _ _ O
results _ _ O
suggest _ _ O
the _ _ O
lateralization _ _ O
and _ _ O
localization _ _ O
value _ _ O
of _ _ O

alone _ _ O
in _ _ O
presurgical _ _ O
evaluation _ _ O

in _ _ O
nature _ _ O

to _ _ O

after _ _ O

Potential _ _ O

in _ _ O
110 _ _ O

(77%, _ _ O

There _ _ O
was _ _ O

in _ _ O
the _ _ O
prognostic _ _ O
model _ _ O
between _ _ O
responders _ _ O
with _ _ O

without _ _ O

at _ _ O

Those _ _ O
with _ _ O
active _ _ O

were _ _ O
unemployed _ _ O
significantly _ _ O
more _ _ O

and _ _ O
perceived _ _ O
their _ _ O

health _ _ O
significantly _ _ O
more _ _ O
affected _ _ O
than _ _ O
those _ _ O
seizure-free _ _ O
without _ _ O
treatment. _ _ O
Duration _ _ O
of _ _ O

treatment _ _ O
was _ _ O
not _ _ O
associated _ _ O
with _ _ O
any _ _ O
difference _ _ O
in _ _ O
subsequent _ _ O
epilepsy _ _ O
risk. _ _ O
This _ _ O
indicates _ _ O
that _ _ O
the _ _ O
timing _ _ O
of _ _ O
withdrawal _ _ O
attempts _ _ O
is _ _ O
unlikely _ _ O
to _ _ O
alter _ _ O
the _ _ O
long-term _ _ O

The _ _ O

prognostic _ _ O
model _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
initial _ _ O
study _ _ O
to _ _ O
predict _ _ O
long-term _ _ O
outcome _ _ O
argues _ _ O
that _ _ O
although _ _ O
prediction _ _ O
of _ _ O
relapse _ _ O
risk _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
shorter _ _ O
term _ _ O
may _ _ O
be _ _ O
possible, _ _ O
the _ _ O
bearing _ _ O
of _ _ O
such _ _ O
models _ _ O
on _ _ O
long-term _ _ O

poor _ _ O

the _ _ O

to _ _ O

This _ _ O
study _ _ O
examines _ _ O
the _ _ O
subjective _ _ O
experience _ _ O
of _ _ O
living _ _ O
with _ _ O
epilepsy _ _ O
by _ _ O
thematically _ _ O
analyzing _ _ O
participants' _ _ O
written _ _ O
accounts _ _ O
of _ _ O
their _ _ O
condition. _ _ O
Writing _ _ O
is _ _ O
seen _ _ O
as _ _ O
an _ _ O
individual _ _ O
act _ _ O
allowing _ _ O
for _ _ O
private _ _ O
exploration, _ _ O
reflection _ _ O
and _ _ O
expression _ _ O
of _ _ O
thoughts _ _ O
and _ _ O
feelings. _ _ O
Participants _ _ O
(n=20) _ _ O
were _ _ O
recruited _ _ O
from _ _ O
a _ _ O
United _ _ B-Patient
Kingdom _ _ I-Patient
hospital _ _ O
and _ _ O
from _ _ O
membership-led _ _ O
organizations _ _ O
for _ _ O
individuals _ _ B-Patient
living _ _ I-Patient
with _ _ I-Patient
seizures. _ _ I-Patient
Participants _ _ O
were _ _ O
asked _ _ O
to _ _ O
produce _ _ O
four _ _ O
pieces _ _ O
of _ _ O
writing: _ _ O
1) _ _ O
about _ _ O
their _ _ O
thoughts _ _ O
and _ _ O
feelings _ _ O
about _ _ O
their _ _ O
condition; _ _ O
2) _ _ O
a _ _ O
letter _ _ O
to _ _ O
their _ _ O
condition; _ _ O
3) _ _ O
a _ _ O
letter _ _ O
to _ _ O
their _ _ O
younger _ _ O
self; _ _ O
and _ _ O
4) _ _ O
about _ _ O
a _ _ O
personal _ _ O
value. _ _ O
All _ _ O
writings _ _ O
were _ _ O
analyzed _ _ O
thematically _ _ O
using _ _ O
a _ _ O
theory- _ _ O
and _ _ O
data-driven _ _ O
approach. _ _ O
Five _ _ O
main-themes _ _ O
and _ _ O
22 _ _ O
sub-themes _ _ O
emerged _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
data. _ _ O
Theme _ _ O
1: _ _ O
'seizure _ _ O
onset' _ _ O
demonstrated _ _ O
that _ _ O
the _ _ O
development _ _ O
of _ _ O
seizures _ _ O
and _ _ O
subsequent _ _ O
diagnosis _ _ O
was _ _ O
an _ _ O
important _ _ O
event _ _ O
that _ _ O
could _ _ O
change _ _ O
an _ _ O
individuals' _ _ O
identity. _ _ O
Theme _ _ O
2: _ _ O
'seizure _ _ O
symptoms' _ _ O
revealed _ _ O
participants _ _ O
externalized _ _ O
their _ _ O
seizures _ _ O
as _ _ O
an _ _ O
intrusive _ _ O
agent _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
constant _ _ O
presence _ _ O
in _ _ O
their _ _ O
lives. _ _ O
Theme _ _ O
3: _ _ O
'treatment _ _ O
and _ _ O
outcome' _ _ O
reflected _ _ O
medication _ _ O
as _ _ O
an _ _ O
essential _ _ O
means _ _ O
to _ _ O
controlling _ _ O
seizures _ _ O
with _ _ O
subsequent _ _ O
side _ _ O
effects _ _ O
being _ _ O
perceived _ _ O
as _ _ O
a _ _ O
compromise. _ _ O
Theme _ _ O
4: _ _ O
'living _ _ O
with _ _ O
epilepsy' _ _ O
explored _ _ O
the _ _ O
consequences _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
condition _ _ O
including _ _ O
restrictions _ _ O
and _ _ O
stigma. _ _ O
Theme _ _ O
5: _ _ O
'displays _ _ O
of _ _ O
coping' _ _ O
demonstrated _ _ O
that, _ _ O
for _ _ O
the _ _ O
most _ _ O
part, _ _ O
participants _ _ O
were _ _ O
keen _ _ O
to _ _ O
present _ _ O
themselves _ _ O
as _ _ O
living _ _ O
well _ _ O
with _ _ O
epilepsy. _ _ O
The _ _ O
results _ _ O
add _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
growing _ _ O
research _ _ O
applying _ _ O
qualitative _ _ O
methodologies _ _ O
to _ _ O
investigate _ _ O
the _ _ O
phenomenology _ _ O
of _ _ O
epilepsy. _ _ O
Qualitative _ _ O
research _ _ O
can _ _ O
improve _ _ O
our _ _ O
understanding _ _ O
and _ _ O
awareness _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
condition, _ _ O
as _ _ O
well _ _ O
as _ _ O
inform _ _ O
clinical _ _ O
practice. _ _ O

useful _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O

However, _ _ O
its _ _ O
