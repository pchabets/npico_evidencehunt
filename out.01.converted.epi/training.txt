the _ _ O

there _ _ O
is _ _ O
a _ _ O

that _ _ O

is _ _ O
a _ _ O
cost-effective _ _ O
alternative _ _ O
to _ _ O
VPS. _ _ O
The _ _ O
evidence _ _ O
suggests _ _ O
that _ _ O
LTG _ _ O
may _ _ O
be _ _ O
a _ _ O
clinical _ _ O
and _ _ O
cost-effective _ _ O
alternative _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
existing _ _ O
standard _ _ O
drug _ _ O
treatment, _ _ O
CBZ, _ _ O
for _ _ O
patients _ _ O
diagnosed _ _ O
as _ _ O

For _ _ O
patients _ _ O
with _ _ O
idiopathic _ _ O
generalised _ _ O
epilepsy _ _ O
or _ _ O
difficult _ _ O
to _ _ O
classify _ _ O
epilepsy, _ _ O
VPS _ _ O
remains _ _ O
the _ _ O
clinically _ _ O
most _ _ O
effective _ _ O
drug, _ _ O
although _ _ O

may _ _ O
be _ _ O
a _ _ O

for _ _ O
some _ _ O

tensor _ _ O
imaging-based _ _ O
deterministic _ _ O
fibre-tracking _ _ O
of _ _ O

was _ _ O
performed. _ _ O
The _ _ O
primary _ _ O

was _ _ O
absence _ _ O

VFD. _ _ O
The _ _ O
secondary _ _ O

Three _ _ O
patients _ _ O
(13 _ _ O

from _ _ O
the _ _ O

showed _ _ O
no _ _ O

Fifteen _ _ O
patients _ _ O
from _ _ O
each _ _ O

(63 _ _ O

became _ _ O
completely _ _ O

(ILAE1). _ _ O
Among _ _ O
those _ _ O

cases, _ _ O
five _ _ O
trans-sylvian _ _ O

a _ _ O

(NNT _ _ O

when _ _ O
VFDs _ _ O
were _ _ O
considered. _ _ O
Although _ _ O
the _ _ O
trans-sylvian _ _ O

experienced _ _ O
more _ _ O
frequent _ _ O
VFDs, _ _ O
the _ _ O

a _ _ O
tendency _ _ O
to _ _ O

compared _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
temporobasal _ _ O
group. _ _ O
DTI-based _ _ O
tracking _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
optic _ _ O

revealed _ _ O
that _ _ O
a _ _ O
lower _ _ O
distance _ _ O
of _ _ O
optic _ _ O
radiation _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
temporal _ _ O
base _ _ O
correlated _ _ O
with _ _ O
increased _ _ O
rate _ _ O
of _ _ O
VFD _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
temporobasal _ _ O
group. _ _ O
Temporobasal _ _ O
SAH _ _ O
shows _ _ O
significantly _ _ O
fewer _ _ O
VFDs _ _ O
and _ _ O
equal _ _ O
seizure-free _ _ O
rate _ _ O
compared _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O
trans-sylvian _ _ O
SAH. _ _ O
However, _ _ O
in _ _ O

in _ _ O
whom _ _ O
the _ _ O
optic _ _ O
radiation _ _ O
is _ _ O
close _ _ O
to _ _ O

the _ _ O

The _ _ O
results _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O
Social _ _ O

scale _ _ O
indicated _ _ O
significantly _ _ O
more _ _ O

in _ _ O
group _ _ O
B _ _ O
(p=0.008). _ _ O
Subjects _ _ O
in _ _ O
group _ _ O
B _ _ O
also _ _ O
expressed _ _ O
more _ _ O
negative _ _ O
attitudes _ _ O
than _ _ O
those _ _ O
in _ _ O
group _ _ O
A _ _ O
when _ _ O
asked _ _ O
about _ _ O
sharing _ _ O
a _ _ O

(p=0.005) _ _ O

either _ _ O
themselves _ _ O

the _ _ O

someone _ _ O
close _ _ O

them _ _ O
(p=0.024). _ _ O
In _ _ O
conclusion, _ _ O
using _ _ O
term _ _ O
epileptic _ _ O
can _ _ O
evoke _ _ O
more _ _ O
negative _ _ O
attitudes _ _ O
toward _ _ O
a _ _ O

However, _ _ O

were _ _ O
maintained _ _ O
at _ _ O
a _ _ O

was _ _ I-Outcome
lower _ _ I-Outcome

The _ _ O
side _ _ O
effects _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O

were _ _ O
dizziness _ _ O

which _ _ O
could _ _ O
be _ _ O
relieved _ _ O
by _ _ O

Therapy _ _ I-Intervention
(ACT) _ _ I-Intervention
and _ _ O

consisted _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O

trial _ _ O
with _ _ O
repeated _ _ O

consisted _ _ O
of _ _ O
12 _ _ O
hours _ _ O
of _ _ O
professional _ _ O

distributed _ _ O
in _ _ O
two _ _ O
individual _ _ O

sessions _ _ O
at _ _ O
6 _ _ O
and _ _ O
12 _ _ O
months _ _ O
posttreatment. _ _ O
Seizure _ _ O
index _ _ O
was _ _ O
continuously _ _ O
assessed _ _ O
during _ _ O
the _ _ O
3-month _ _ O
baseline _ _ O
and _ _ O
12-month _ _ O
follow-up. _ _ O
Quality _ _ O
of _ _ O

was _ _ O
measured _ _ O
after _ _ O
treatment _ _ O
and _ _ O
at _ _ O
the _ _ O
6-month _ _ O
and _ _ O
1-year _ _ O
follow-ups. _ _ O
The _ _ B-Outcome
results _ _ I-Outcome
indicate _ _ I-Outcome
that _ _ I-Outcome
both _ _ I-Outcome
ACT _ _ I-Outcome
and _ _ I-Outcome
yoga _ _ I-Outcome
significantly _ _ I-Outcome
reduce _ _ I-Outcome

index _ _ I-Outcome
and _ _ I-Outcome
increase _ _ I-Outcome
quality _ _ I-Outcome

ACT _ _ O
reduced _ _ O
seizure _ _ O
index _ _ O
significantly _ _ O
more _ _ O
as _ _ O

Participants _ _ O
in _ _ O
both _ _ O
the _ _ O
ACT _ _ O

improved _ _ O
their _ _ O

life _ _ O
significantly _ _ O
as _ _ O
measured _ _ O
by _ _ O
one _ _ O
of _ _ O
two _ _ O

The _ _ O
ACT _ _ O

increased _ _ O
their _ _ O

significantly _ _ O
as _ _ O
compared _ _ O
with _ _ O
the _ _ O

as _ _ O
measured _ _ O
by _ _ O
the _ _ O
WHOQOL-BREF, _ _ O

that _ _ O
complementary _ _ O
treatments, _ _ O
such _ _ O

There _ _ O
was _ _ O
a _ _ O
suggestion _ _ O
in _ _ O
those _ _ O
with _ _ O
mild _ _ O
to _ _ O
moderate _ _ O
ID _ _ O
that _ _ O
the _ _ O

associated _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
small _ _ O
reduction _ _ O
in _ _ O

(standard _ _ O

of _ _ O

on _ _ O

of _ _ O
the _ _ O

suggested _ _ O
that _ _ O
the _ _ O
competency _ _ O
framework _ _ O
intervention _ _ O
was _ _ O
likely _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
cost-effective, _ _ O
primarily _ _ O
because _ _ O

Treatment _ _ O
as _ _ O

varied _ _ O

Overall, _ _ O
for _ _ O
adults _ _ O
with _ _ O
an _ _ O
ID _ _ O
and _ _ O
epilepsy, _ _ O
the _ _ O
framework _ _ O
conferred _ _ O
no _ _ O
clinical _ _ O
benefit _ _ O
compared _ _ O
with _ _ O
usual _ _ O
treatment. _ _ O
The _ _ O
economic _ _ O
analysis _ _ O
suggested _ _ O
that _ _ O
there _ _ O
may _ _ O
be _ _ O
a _ _ O
role _ _ O
for _ _ O
the _ _ O

in _ _ O
enhancing _ _ O
the _ _ O

Therefore, _ _ O
in _ _ O

may _ _ O
be _ _ O
associated _ _ O

The _ _ O

The _ _ O

an _ _ O

with _ _ O
a _ _ O

burden, _ _ O
the _ _ O
rate _ _ O

increased. _ _ O
A _ _ O
number _ _ O
of _ _ O
operational _ _ O
concerns _ _ O

dietetic _ _ O
time _ _ O
were _ _ O
also _ _ O
highlighted _ _ O
impacting _ _ O
on _ _ O
the _ _ O

rate. _ _ O
However, _ _ O
the _ _ O

as _ _ O

Having _ _ O
epilepsy _ _ O
requires _ _ O
individuals _ _ O
to _ _ O
learn _ _ O
about _ _ O
self-management. _ _ O
So _ _ O
far, _ _ O

have _ _ O
not _ _ O

method _ _ O
influences _ _ O
participants' _ _ O

We _ _ O
aimed _ _ O
to _ _ O
interview _ _ O
participants _ _ B-Patient
who _ _ I-Patient
had _ _ I-Patient
attended _ _ I-Patient
a _ _ I-Patient
course, _ _ I-Patient
as _ _ O
part _ _ O
of _ _ O
a _ _ O
randomized _ _ O

trial, _ _ O
to _ _ O
examine: _ _ O
(i) _ _ O
their _ _ O

of _ _ O
what _ _ O
they _ _ O
valued _ _ O
and _ _ O
negative _ _ O
aspects _ _ O

in _ _ O
what _ _ O
ways _ _ O
they _ _ O
continued _ _ O
to _ _ O
make _ _ O

training. _ _ O
Twenty _ _ O

were _ _ O
selected _ _ O
within _ _ O
6 _ _ O
months _ _ O
of _ _ O
undertaking _ _ O
a _ _ O
course _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O

Semi-structured _ _ O

were _ _ O

representative _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O

the _ _ O

half _ _ I-Patient
were _ _ I-Patient
male, _ _ I-Patient

three-quarters _ _ I-Patient
had _ _ I-Patient
had _ _ I-Patient
epilepsy _ _ I-Patient
for _ _ I-Patient
over _ _ I-Patient
10 _ _ I-Patient
years _ _ I-Patient
and _ _ I-Patient
had _ _ I-Patient

one _ _ I-Patient
or _ _ I-Patient
more _ _ I-Patient
seizures _ _ I-Patient
in _ _ I-Patient
the _ _ I-Patient

Participants _ _ O
valued _ _ O
the _ _ O
opportunity _ _ O
to _ _ O
meet _ _ O
'people _ _ O

them'. _ _ O
Structured _ _ O
learning _ _ O
methods _ _ O
encouraged _ _ O
them _ _ O
to _ _ O
share _ _ O
and _ _ O
compare _ _ O
feelings _ _ O
and _ _ O
experience. _ _ O
Specific _ _ O
benefits _ _ O
included: _ _ O
overcoming _ _ O
the _ _ O
sense _ _ O
of _ _ O
'being _ _ O
alone' _ _ O
and _ _ O
improving _ _ O
self-acceptance _ _ O
through _ _ O
meeting _ _ O
people _ _ O
with _ _ O
similar _ _ O
experience. _ _ O
Over _ _ O
half _ _ O
reported _ _ O
that _ _ O
this, _ _ O
and _ _ O
comparison _ _ O
of _ _ O
attitudes _ _ O
and _ _ O
experience, _ _ O
helped _ _ O
them _ _ O
to _ _ O
improve _ _ O
their _ _ O
confidence _ _ O
to _ _ O
talk _ _ O
openly, _ _ O
and _ _ O
make _ _ O
changes _ _ O
in _ _ O
health _ _ O
behaviours. _ _ O
People _ _ O
feel _ _ O
socially _ _ O
isolated _ _ O
in _ _ O
long-term _ _ O
poorly _ _ O
controlled _ _ O
epilepsy. _ _ O
They _ _ O
gain _ _ O
confidence _ _ O
and _ _ O
self-acceptance _ _ O
from _ _ O
interactive _ _ O
groups. _ _ O
Expert-facilitated _ _ O
courses _ _ O
that _ _ O
encourage _ _ O
experiential _ _ O
learning _ _ O
can _ _ O
help _ _ O
people _ _ O
learn _ _ O
from _ _ O
each _ _ O

and _ _ O
this _ _ O
may _ _ O

subgroups _ _ O
(1500 _ _ O

stimulation _ _ O
site _ _ O
and _ _ O

However, _ _ O
interictal _ _ O

(-54.9%, _ _ O

its _ _ O

that _ _ O
the _ _ O
use _ _ O

The _ _ O

Median _ _ O
percentage _ _ O

analysis _ _ O
between _ _ O
the _ _ O

statistical _ _ O

the _ _ O

14.93% _ _ O

for _ _ O
the _ _ O
levetiracetam _ _ O
3000-mg _ _ O
group. _ _ O
All _ _ O
levetiracetam _ _ O
doses _ _ O
were _ _ O
well _ _ O
tolerated. _ _ O
The _ _ O
main _ _ O
difference _ _ O
between _ _ O
the _ _ O
two _ _ O
trials _ _ O
was _ _ O
a _ _ O
high _ _ O
placebo _ _ O

in _ _ O
the _ _ O

The _ _ O
primary _ _ O
efficacy _ _ O
analysis _ _ O
did _ _ O

a _ _ O

attributed _ _ O
to _ _ O
an _ _ O

exploratory _ _ O
analysis _ _ O

that _ _ O

poor _ _ O

will _ _ O
be _ _ O
offered _ _ O
the _ _ O
possibility _ _ O
of _ _ O
participating _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
MCI. _ _ O
The _ _ O
study _ _ O
will _ _ O
consist _ _ O
of _ _ O
three _ _ O
parts: _ _ O
1) _ _ O
a _ _ O
clinical _ _ O
effectiveness _ _ O
study, _ _ O
2) _ _ O
a _ _ O
cost-effectiveness _ _ O
study, _ _ O
and _ _ O
3) _ _ O
process _ _ O
evaluation. _ _ O
The _ _ O
primary _ _ O
outcome _ _ O
will _ _ O
be _ _ O
self-efficacy. _ _ O
Secondary _ _ O
outcomes _ _ O
include _ _ O
adherence, _ _ O

change _ _ O
in _ _ O

and _ _ O
societal _ _ O
costs. _ _ O
Outcome _ _ O
assessments _ _ O
will _ _ O
be _ _ O
done _ _ O
using _ _ O
questionnaires _ _ O
at _ _ O
baseline _ _ O
and _ _ O
after _ _ O
3, _ _ O
6, _ _ O
9, _ _ O
and _ _ O
12 _ _ O
months _ _ O
(last _ _ O
two _ _ O
applicable _ _ O
only _ _ O
for _ _ O

group). _ _ O
In _ _ O
times _ _ O
of _ _ O
budget _ _ O
constraints, _ _ O
MCI _ _ O
could _ _ O
be _ _ O
a _ _ O
valuable _ _ O
addition _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
current _ _ O
healthcare _ _ O
provision _ _ O
for _ _ O
epilepsy, _ _ O
as _ _ O
it _ _ O
is _ _ O
expected _ _ O
that _ _ O
higher _ _ O
concordance _ _ O
and _ _ O
self-efficacy _ _ O
will _ _ O
result _ _ O
in _ _ O
reduced _ _ O
use _ _ O
of _ _ O
healthcare _ _ O
resources _ _ O
and _ _ O
an _ _ O
increased _ _ O
QOL. _ _ O
Accordingly, _ _ O
this _ _ O
study _ _ O
is _ _ O
aimed _ _ O
helping _ _ O
patients _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
their _ _ O
own _ _ O

of _ _ O
health _ _ O

shifting _ _ O

recommend _ _ O

The _ _ O
purpose _ _ O
of _ _ O
this _ _ O

was _ _ O
to _ _ O
rigorously _ _ O
evaluate _ _ O
this _ _ O
recommendation _ _ O

Electroencephalograms _ _ O

The _ _ O

outcome _ _ O
was _ _ O
the _ _ O
proportion _ _ O

normal _ _ O
routine _ _ O
electroencephalogram _ _ O

Although _ _ O

the _ _ O
night _ _ O
before _ _ O
(4.9 _ _ O
vs _ _ O
7.9 _ _ O
hours) _ _ O
and _ _ O
more _ _ O
sleep _ _ O
during _ _ O
electroencephalograms _ _ O
(73% _ _ O
vs _ _ O
55%), _ _ O
the _ _ O
increase _ _ O
in _ _ O
electroencephalogram _ _ O
yield _ _ O
was _ _ O
borderline _ _ O
significant _ _ O
(56% _ _ O
normal _ _ O
sleep-deprived _ _ O
electroencephalogram _ _ O
versus _ _ O
68% _ _ O
normal _ _ O
routine _ _ O
electroencephalogram). _ _ O
Moreover, _ _ O
sleep _ _ O
during _ _ O
the _ _ O
electroencephalogram _ _ O
did _ _ O
not _ _ O
increase _ _ O
its _ _ O
diagnostic _ _ O
yield. _ _ O
Sleep-deprived _ _ O
electroencephalogram _ _ O
yield _ _ O
tended _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
higher _ _ O
in _ _ O
children _ _ O
with _ _ O
preelectroencephalogram _ _ O
clinical _ _ O
diagnosis _ _ O
of _ _ O
seizure(s) _ _ O
and _ _ O
at _ _ O
older _ _ O
ages _ _ O
(>3 _ _ O
years). _ _ O
Sleep _ _ O
deprivation, _ _ O
but _ _ O
not _ _ O
sleep _ _ O
during _ _ O
the _ _ O
electroencephalogram, _ _ O
modestly _ _ O

the _ _ O
electroencephalogram _ _ O
in _ _ O

of _ _ O

as _ _ O
an _ _ O

for _ _ O

Phase _ _ O
III _ _ O

that _ _ O
a _ _ O
significant _ _ O
relationship _ _ O

between _ _ O
increases _ _ O
in _ _ O

plasma _ _ O
concentration _ _ O
(i.e., _ _ O
systemic _ _ O
exposure) _ _ O

In _ _ O
addition, _ _ O
increases _ _ O
in _ _ O

plasma _ _ O
concentration _ _ O
may _ _ O
potentially _ _ O
be _ _ O
associated _ _ O

in _ _ O
AE _ _ O
rates. _ _ O
The _ _ O
model-predicted _ _ O
concentration-safety _ _ O
profile _ _ O
of _ _ O

does _ _ O
not _ _ O
appear _ _ O
to _ _ O
be _ _ O
affected _ _ O
by _ _ O

age, _ _ O
gender, _ _ O
or _ _ O
ethnicity. _ _ O
Although _ _ O
concomitant _ _ O
EIAEDs _ _ O
may _ _ O
influence _ _ O
perampanel _ _ O
PK, _ _ O
they _ _ O
do _ _ O
not _ _ O

to _ _ O
alter _ _ O
the _ _ O

and _ _ O

Recent _ _ O
findings _ _ O
in _ _ O
monkeys _ _ O
suggest _ _ O
that _ _ O
lesion-induced _ _ O
plasticity _ _ O
may _ _ O
contribute _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
seeming _ _ O

We _ _ O

this _ _ O

in _ _ O
two _ _ B-Patient

Compared _ _ O

(n _ _ O

showed _ _ O
a _ _ O
significant _ _ O
delay-dependent _ _ O
deficit _ _ O
in _ _ O

of _ _ O

associations. _ _ O
No _ _ O
such _ _ O
deficit _ _ O
was _ _ O
observed _ _ O
in _ _ O
hippocampal _ _ O
sclerosis _ _ O
patients, _ _ O
which _ _ O
appeared _ _ O
to _ _ O
benefit _ _ O
from _ _ O
a _ _ O
compensatory _ _ O
mechanism _ _ O
that _ _ O
was _ _ O
inefficient _ _ O
in _ _ O
tumour _ _ O
patients. _ _ O
These _ _ O
results _ _ O
indicate _ _ O
that _ _ O
long-standing _ _ O
hippocampal _ _ O
damage _ _ O
can _ _ O
yield _ _ O
significant _ _ O
functional _ _ O
reorganization _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O

substrate _ _ O
underlying _ _ O
memory _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O
human _ _ O

We _ _ O
suppose _ _ O
that _ _ O
this _ _ O
process _ _ O
accounts _ _ O
for _ _ O
some _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O

that _ _ O

Interestingly, _ _ O
some _ _ O

experience _ _ O
absence _ _ O
seizures _ _ O
while _ _ O
performing _ _ O

in _ _ O
the _ _ O

yet _ _ O

not _ _ O
experience _ _ O

on _ _ O

In _ _ O
most _ _ O
instances, _ _ O
HV _ _ B-Intervention
during _ _ O
routine _ _ O
EEG _ _ O
is _ _ O
performed _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O

in _ _ O

Therefore, _ _ O
we _ _ O
hypothesized _ _ O
that _ _ O
the _ _ O

HV _ _ B-Intervention
is _ _ O
performed _ _ O
may _ _ O

among _ _ O

During _ _ O

to _ _ O
perform _ _ O

twice, _ _ O
in _ _ O

Twenty _ _ O

diagnosed _ _ I-Patient

Seventeen _ _ B-Outcome
of _ _ I-Outcome
the _ _ I-Outcome

experienced _ _ I-Outcome

13 _ _ I-Outcome

All _ _ O
patients _ _ O
that _ _ O
had _ _ O
absence _ _ O
seizures _ _ O
during _ _ O

also _ _ O
had _ _ O

during _ _ O

HV. _ _ O
Among _ _ O
patients _ _ O
with _ _ O
absences _ _ O
in _ _ O
both _ _ O
positions, _ _ O
seizure _ _ O
duration _ _ O
was _ _ O
significantly _ _ O
shorter _ _ O
during _ _ O

HV _ _ O
(mean _ _ O
8.69 _ _ O

than _ _ O
during _ _ O

HV _ _ O
(mean _ _ O
12 _ _ O

(p _ _ O

An _ _ O
opposite _ _ O
tendency _ _ O
was _ _ O
seen _ _ O
in _ _ O
the _ _ O

(4-7 _ _ O

with _ _ O
shorter _ _ O

HV _ _ O
in _ _ O

This _ _ O
study _ _ O
examines _ _ O
the _ _ O
subjective _ _ O
experience _ _ O
of _ _ O
living _ _ O
with _ _ O
epilepsy _ _ O
by _ _ O
thematically _ _ O
analyzing _ _ O
participants' _ _ O
written _ _ O
accounts _ _ O
of _ _ O
their _ _ O
condition. _ _ O
Writing _ _ O
is _ _ O
seen _ _ O
as _ _ O
an _ _ O
individual _ _ O
act _ _ O
allowing _ _ O
for _ _ O
private _ _ O
exploration, _ _ O
reflection _ _ O
and _ _ O
expression _ _ O
of _ _ O
thoughts _ _ O
and _ _ O
feelings. _ _ O
Participants _ _ O
(n=20) _ _ O
were _ _ O
recruited _ _ O
from _ _ O
a _ _ O
United _ _ B-Patient
Kingdom _ _ I-Patient
hospital _ _ O
and _ _ O
from _ _ O
membership-led _ _ O
organizations _ _ O
for _ _ O
individuals _ _ B-Patient
living _ _ I-Patient
with _ _ I-Patient
seizures. _ _ I-Patient
Participants _ _ O
were _ _ O
asked _ _ O
to _ _ O
produce _ _ O
four _ _ O
pieces _ _ O
of _ _ O
writing: _ _ O
1) _ _ O
about _ _ O
their _ _ O
thoughts _ _ O
and _ _ O
feelings _ _ O
about _ _ O
their _ _ O
condition; _ _ O
2) _ _ O
a _ _ O
letter _ _ O
to _ _ O
their _ _ O
condition; _ _ O
3) _ _ O
a _ _ O
letter _ _ O
to _ _ O
their _ _ O
younger _ _ O
self; _ _ O
and _ _ O
4) _ _ O
about _ _ O
a _ _ O
personal _ _ O
value. _ _ O
All _ _ O
writings _ _ O
were _ _ O
analyzed _ _ O
thematically _ _ O
using _ _ O
a _ _ O
theory- _ _ O
and _ _ O
data-driven _ _ O
approach. _ _ O
Five _ _ O
main-themes _ _ O
and _ _ O
22 _ _ O
sub-themes _ _ O
emerged _ _ O
from _ _ O
the _ _ O
data. _ _ O
Theme _ _ O
1: _ _ O
'seizure _ _ O
onset' _ _ O
demonstrated _ _ O
that _ _ O
the _ _ O
development _ _ O
of _ _ O
seizures _ _ O
and _ _ O
subsequent _ _ O
diagnosis _ _ O
was _ _ O
an _ _ O
important _ _ O
event _ _ O
that _ _ O
could _ _ O
change _ _ O
an _ _ O
individuals' _ _ O
identity. _ _ O
Theme _ _ O
2: _ _ O
'seizure _ _ O
symptoms' _ _ O
revealed _ _ O
participants _ _ O
externalized _ _ O
their _ _ O
seizures _ _ O
as _ _ O
an _ _ O
intrusive _ _ O
agent _ _ O
with _ _ O
a _ _ O
constant _ _ O
presence _ _ O
in _ _ O
their _ _ O
lives. _ _ O
Theme _ _ O
3: _ _ O
'treatment _ _ O
and _ _ O
outcome' _ _ O
reflected _ _ O
medication _ _ O
as _ _ O
an _ _ O
essential _ _ O
means _ _ O
to _ _ O
controlling _ _ O
seizures _ _ O
with _ _ O
subsequent _ _ O
side _ _ O
effects _ _ O
being _ _ O
perceived _ _ O
as _ _ O
a _ _ O
compromise. _ _ O
Theme _ _ O
4: _ _ O
'living _ _ O
with _ _ O
epilepsy' _ _ O
explored _ _ O
the _ _ O
consequences _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
condition _ _ O
including _ _ O
restrictions _ _ O
and _ _ O
stigma. _ _ O
Theme _ _ O
5: _ _ O
'displays _ _ O
of _ _ O
coping' _ _ O
demonstrated _ _ O
that, _ _ O
for _ _ O
the _ _ O
most _ _ O
part, _ _ O
participants _ _ O
were _ _ O
keen _ _ O
to _ _ O
present _ _ O
themselves _ _ O
as _ _ O
living _ _ O
well _ _ O
with _ _ O
epilepsy. _ _ O
The _ _ O
results _ _ O
add _ _ O
to _ _ O
the _ _ O
growing _ _ O
research _ _ O
applying _ _ O
qualitative _ _ O
methodologies _ _ O
to _ _ O
investigate _ _ O
the _ _ O
phenomenology _ _ O
of _ _ O
epilepsy. _ _ O
Qualitative _ _ O
research _ _ O
can _ _ O
improve _ _ O
our _ _ O
understanding _ _ O
and _ _ O
awareness _ _ O
of _ _ O
the _ _ O
condition, _ _ O
as _ _ O
well _ _ O
as _ _ O
