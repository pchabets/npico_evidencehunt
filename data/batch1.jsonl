{"id": 2, "data": "Rationale, Design, and Implementation of Intensive Risk Factor Treatment in the CREST2 Trial. The CREST2 trial (Carotid Revascularization and Medical Management for Asymptomatic Carotid Stenosis) is comparing intensive medical management (IMM) alone to IMM plus revascularization with carotid endarterectomy or transfemoral carotid artery stenting for preventing stroke or death within 44 days after randomization or ipsilateral ischemic stroke thereafter. There are extensive clinical trial data on outcomes after revascularization of asymptomatic carotid stenosis, but not for IMM. As such, the experimental treatment in CREST2 is IMM, which is described in this article. IMM consists of aspirin 325 mg/day and intensive risk factor management, primarily targeting systolic blood pressure <130 mm Hg (initially systolic blood pressure <140 mm Hg) and LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol <70 mg/dL. Secondary risk factor targets focus on tobacco smoking, non-HDL (high-density lipoprotein), HbA1c (hemoglobin A1c), physical activity, and weight. Risk factor management is performed by site personnel and a lifestyle coaching program delivered by telephone. We report interim risk factor data on 1618 patients at baseline and last follow-up through 24 months. The mean baseline LDL of 80.5 mg/dL improved to 66.7 mg/dL. The mean baseline systolic blood pressure of 139.7 mm Hg improved to 130.3 mm Hg. The proportion of patients in-target improved from 43% to 61% for systolic blood pressure <130 mm Hg and from 45% to 67% for LDL<70 mg/dL (both changes P<0.001). The rigorous multimodal approach to intensive stroke risk factor management in CREST2 has resulted in significant improvements in risk factor control that will enable a comparison of cutting-edge medical care to revascularization in patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis.

Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is the most frequently reported adverse effect of oxaliplatin. In this study, we set out to evaluate the role of the panaceo-micro-activation (PMA) zeolite in the reduction of the incidence of CIPN and hematological and liver toxicity. The possible impact of the PMA-zeolite as an adjuvant therapeutic agent is based on its detoxification properties toward agents promoting the development of neuropathy (e.g., ammonium - recognized as a neurotoxic agent produced by tumors), as well as its positive impact on immunity and oxidative stress through its effects in the gastrointestinal tract. From April 2015 to October 2018, a total of 120 patients (pts) diagnosed with predominantly colorectal cancer requiring oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy were randomized to receive either the PMA-zeolite (Multizeo Med) or placebo while undergoing oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy. A nerve-conduction study (NCS)&nbsp;was planned at the baseline, after three and six months of chemotherapy, to evaluate CIPN. Furthermore, the evaluation of hematological and liver toxicity was performed during every cycle of chemotherapy. 70.6% and 64.3% of patients developed CIPN in the placebo and the PMA-zeolite group, respectively. Patients treated with the PMA-zeolite were able to undergo more cycles of chemotherapy (p = 0.03), which also indicates a significant improvement in tolerance to the therapy. The group treated with the PMA-zeolite showed a lower CIPN (although not statistically significant within the whole group of subjects) compared to patients receiving placebo. This advantage was, however, statistically significant in men (p = 0.047). In addition, supplementation with the PMA-zeolite resulted in a lower incidence of severe-grade hematological toxicity (trend toward statistical significance of p = 0.09 was observed). Cancer patients may benefit from the therapy with the appropriate certified zeolite-products (e.g., the PMA-zeolite) for human use in CIPN. The lower CIPN (statistically significant results in the male subgroup) was accompanied by a trend of lower incidence of severe-grade hematological toxicity.

Extended-release formulations of naltrexone have emerged as effective treatment options for opioid use disorder. This post-hoc analysis examined the temporal relationship between episodes of opioid use and subsequent dropout in a placebo-controlled trial of extended-release injection naltrexone (XR-NTX) to draw inferences about the mechanism by which extended blockade of opioid receptors translates into clinical effectiveness. This was a 24-week multiple-site, double-blind, randomized trial of monthly XR-NTX versus placebo injections. We analyzed time to dropout from treatment using survival analysis with an extended Cox model as a function of treatment (XR-NTX versus placebo) and with weekly urine drug test (UDT) results for opioids at each week as a time-dependent covariate.

XR-NTX injection or placebo injection every 4 weeks with weekly clinic visits and biweekly counseling. Urine toxicology for opioids measured weekly and week of dropout from treatment. The Cox model yielded a significant interaction of time-dependent urine toxicology by treatment (P = 0.024). Among patients receiving placebo, a positive UDT in a given week increased the risk for dropout from treatment in the subsequent week [hazard ratio (HR) = 6.25; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 3.6-10.0], whereas among patients receiving XR-NTX, a positive UDT result showed no significant effect on risk for dropout (HR = 1.67; 95% CI = 0.6-4.5). The proportion of patients who completed all 24 weeks without any positive UDT result was 31% on XR-NTX compared with 20% on placebo (P = 0.051).

The aims were to compare the therapeutic ranges and clinical outcomes between the conventional and genotype-guided tacrolimus doses. This randomized controlled study compared 63 cases of the conventional tacrolimus dose group (0.1 mg/kg/day) with 62 cases of the genotype-guided doses group of 0.125, 0.1 and 0.08 mg/kg for CYP3A5*1/*1, *1/*3, and *3/*3 genotypes for the initial 3 days of kidney transplantation.

{"id": 7, "data": "The development of an alternative growth chart for estimated fetal weight in the absence of ultrasound: Application in Indonesia. A fetal growth chart is a vital tool for assessing fetal risk during pregnancy. Since fetal weight cannot be directly measured, its reliable estimation at different stages of pregnancy has become an essential issue in obstetrics and gynecology and one of the critical elements in developing a fetal growth chart for estimated fetal weight. In Indonesia, however, a reliable model and data for fetal weight estimation remain challenging, and this causes the absence of a standard fetal growth chart in antenatal care practices. This study has reviewed and evaluated the efficacy of the prediction models used to develop the most prominent growth charts for estimated fetal weight. The study also has discussed the potential challenges when such surveillance tools are utilized in low resource settings. The study, then, has proposed an alternative model based only on maternal fundal height to estimate fetal weight. Finally, the study has developed an alternative growth chart and assessed its capability in detecting abnormal patterns of fetal growth during pregnancy. Prospective data from twenty selected primary health centers in South Kalimantan, Indonesia, were used for the proposed model validation, the comparison task, and the alternative growth chart development using both descriptive and inferential statistics. Results show that limited access to individual fetal biometric characteristics and low-quality data on personal maternal and neonatal characteristics make the existing fetal growth charts less applicable in the local setting. The proposed model based only on maternal fundal height has a comparable ability in predicting fetal weight with less error than the existing models. The results have shown that the developed chart based on the proposed model can effectively detect signs of abnormality, between 20 and 41 weeks, among low birth weight babies in the absence of ultrasound.

Introduction: ADVANCE was a large, multinational clinical study conducted over 5 years in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In all, 11,140 patients were randomly assigned to receive gliclazide-based intensive glucose control (IGC) or standard glucose control (SGC). IGC was shown to significantly reduce the incidence of major macrovascular and microvascular events (composite endpoint) or major microvascular events compared with SGC, primarily by enhancing renal protection. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of IGC vs. SGC, based on the ADVANCE results, from a Vietnamese healthcare payer perspective. Materials and Methods: A partitioned survival times model across five health states (no complications, myocardial infarction, stroke, end-stage renal disease [ESRD], and diabetes-related eye-disease) was designed. Time-to-event curves were informed by the cumulative incidence of events and corresponding hazard ratios from the ADVANCE study. Health outcomes were expressed in terms of ESRD avoided and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Costs (in US $) comprised treatment costs and health state costs. Utility weights and costs were documented from literature reporting Vietnamese estimates. For sensitivity analyses, all parameters were individually varied within their 95% confidence interval bounds (when available) or within a ±30% range. Results: Over a 5-year horizon, IGC avoided 6.5 additional ESRD events per 1,000 patients treated compared with SGC (IGC, 3.5 events vs. SGC, 10.0 events) and provided 0.016 additional QALYs (IGC, 3.570 QALYs vs. SGC, 3.555 QALYs). Total costs were similar for the two strategies (IGC, $3,786 vs. SGC, $3,757). Although the total drug costs were markedly higher for IGC compared with SGC ($1,703 vs. $873), this was largely offset by the savings from better renal protection with IGC (IGC, $577 vs. SGC, $1,508). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of IGC vs. SGC was $1,878/QALY gained, far below the threshold recommended by the World Health Organization (i.e., 1-3 × gross domestic product per inhabitant ≈$7,500 in Vietnam). The ICER of IGC vs. SGC per ESRD event avoided was $4,559/event. The findings were robust to sensitivity analysis.

In this study we assess the cost-effectiveness of this guideline based stepped care model versus treatment as usual in depression. This prospective cluster-randomized controlled trial included 737 depressive adult patients. Primary care practices were randomized to an intervention (IG) or a control group (CG). The intervention consisted of a four-level stepped care model. The CG received treatment as usual.

Resource utilization was assessed by patient questionnaires. Missing values were imputed by 'multiple imputation using chained equations' based on predictive mean matching. We calculated adjusted group differences in costs and effects as well as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. To describe the statistical and decision uncertainty cost-effectiveness acceptability curves were constructed based on net-benefit regressions with bootstrapped standard errors (1000 replications).

In this post hoc analysis of men with available baseline plasma T concentrations, we examined the relationship between clinical/demographic characteristics and T concentrations both as a continuous and dichotomous variable (<300 ng/dL [low T] vs. ≥300 ng/dL [normal T]) on rates of pre-specified CV outcomes, using Cox proportional hazards models. Among 2118 male participants in whom T concentrations were measured, 643 (30%) had low T and 1475 had normal T concentrations at baseline. The low T group had higher rates of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, elevated body mass index, metabolic syndrome, higher blood glucose, hemoglobin A1c, and triglyceride levels, but lower levels of both low-density lipoprotein and HDL-cholesterol, and a lower rate of prior myocardial infarction (MI). Men with low T had a higher risk of the primary composite outcome of coronary heart disease (CHD) death, MI, stroke, hospitalization for acute coronary syndrome, or coronary or cerebral revascularization (20.1%) compared with the normal T group (15.2%); final adjusted HR 1.23, P = .07, and a higher risk of the CHD death, MI, and stroke composite endpoint (11.8% vs. 8.2%; final adjusted HR 1.37, P = .04), respectively.

Background: Lasmiditan is a selective serotonin (1F) receptor agonist approved for acute treatment of migraine with 3 doses: 50, 100, and 200 mg.Objective: To help provide dosing insights, we assessed the efficacy and safety of lasmiditan in patients who treated two migraine attacks with the same or different lasmiditan doses.Methods: Integrated analyses used data from the migraine attack treated in either of two controlled, Phase 3, single attack studies (SAMURAI/SPARTAN), and after the first attack treated in the open-label GLADIATOR extension study. Eight patient groups were created based on the initial dose received in SAMURAI or SPARTAN and the subsequent dose in GLADIATOR: placebo-100, placebo-200, 50-100, 50-200, 100-100, 100-200, 200-100, 200-200. Migraine pain freedom, migraine-related functional disability freedom, most bothersome symptom (MBS) freedom, and pain relief were evaluated at 2-h post-dose. The occurrence of most common treatment-emergent adverse events (MC-TEAE) was evaluated. Shift analyses were performed for pain freedom and ≥1 MC-TEAE. The incidence of patients with a specific outcome from the first and subsequent doses were compared within each dose change group using McNemar's test.Results: Small, but consistent, increases in incidences of pain freedom, migraine-related functional disability freedom, MBS freedom, and pain relief occurred when the second lasmiditan dose was higher than the initial dose. For patients starting on 50 mg, increasing to 100 or 200 mg provided a positive efficacy-TEAE balance, despite an increase in incidence of ≥1 MC-TEAE. For patients starting on 100 mg, increasing to 200 mg provided a positive efficacy-TEAE balance. If the initial dose was 100 or 200 mg, the incidence of patients experiencing ≥1 MC-TEAE decreased or stayed the same with their subsequent dose, regardless of dose. Decreasing from 200 to 100 mg led to a decrease in patients with pain freedom and ≥1 MC-TEAE, resulting in a neutral efficacy-TEAE balance. Shift analyses supported these findings.Conclusion: A positive efficacy-TEAE balance exists for patients increasing their lasmiditan dose for treatment of a subsequent migraine attack.

The IMAGINE is a post hoc image analysis and cytokine expression assessment of the Efficacy & Safety Trial of Intravitreal Injections Combined With PRP for CSME Secondary to Diabetes Mellitus (DAVE) randomized clinical trial. Subjects were categorized as anatomical responders or nonresponders, and within the responder group as rebounders and non-rebounders based on quantitative, longitudinal OCT criteria. Retinal layer and fluid features were extracted using an OCT machine-learning augmented segmentation platform. Responders were further sub-classified by rapidity of response. Aqueous concentrations of 54 cytokines were measured at multiple timepoints. Expression was compared between responder groups and correlated with OCT imaging biomarkers. Of the 24 eyes studied, 79% were anatomical responders with 38% super responders, 17% early responders, and 25% slow responders. Twenty-one percent were nonresponders.

This evaluator-blinded pilot study compared the efficacy and tolerability of two marketed topical combination acne gels, clindamycin 1%-tretinoin 0.025% (CT) and benzoyl peroxide 2.5%-adapalene 0.1% (BA) in 20 patients with mild to moderate acne vulgaris. Gels were applied daily on opposite sides of the face for 21 days. The primary outcome was difference in transepidermal water loss (TEWL) at the end of treatment. Secondary endpoints were skin moisture content measurement, Investigators' Global Assessment, subject self-assessments (SSA) of burning/stinging, itching, erythema, and dryness/scaling, and Comparative Participant Satisfaction Questionnaire (CPSQ). Efficacy was assessed by inflammatory and non- inflammatory acne efflorescences counts. TEWL increased significantly for both CT and BA (+57.74%, P=0.002; +58.77%, P<0.001); skin moisture content significantly decreased only for BA (-16.47%, P=0.02). Only BA showed a significant increase in erythema and dryness/scaling (P=0.027 and P=0.014) and in SSA burning/stinging (P=0.04). Patient satisfaction evaluation also reflected the strong BA irritation. Although CT and BA both reduced acne lesions (P<0.001) and more patients preferred to continue with CT, subject perception of acne improvement was higher for BA. These findings suggest that CT and BA have similar efficacy in the treatment of mild to moderate papulopustular acne. However, CT was better tolerated than BA by both medical and subject evaluation.

Younger patients who underwent vitrectomy for proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) display more aggressive nature distinguished from the older patients. Preoperative anti-VEGF therapy has been widely used as an adjunct for PDR surgery. However, the effect of anti-VEGF administration in young diabetics has rarely been evaluated in previous studies. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of ranibizumab pretreatment on vitrectomy surgery in young patients with PDR. This was a prospective nonrandomized comparative study. Young patients (<40 years old) undergoing diabetic vitrectomy with or without ranibizumab pretreatment (25 eyes in each group) were analyzed in this study. The use of the drug was determined by the patients' own preference. The two surgical groups were matched according to a complexity score. Intravitreal injection of ranibizumab (IVR) was performed 3-5 days prior to the vitrectomy surgery in the IVR group. Intraoperative records including total surgical time, intraoperative bleeding, the use of endodiathermy, the frequency of relaxing retinotomies, the incidence of iatrogenic retinal breaks, and the use of perfluorocarbon liquid (PFCL) and silicone oil tamponade, and postoperative indices regarding recurrent vitreous hemorrhage (VH), neovascular glaucoma (NVG), recurrent retinal detachment, and visual outcome were evaluated between the two groups. All patients were followed up for one year after surgery. In young PDR patients, the severity of intraoperative bleeding was significantly lower in the IVR group than in the control group (P=0.04). The total surgical time was shorter in the IVR group than in the control group. However, the rate of relaxing retinotomy, the incidence of iatrogenic retinal breaks and the use of PFCL and silicone oil tamponade were not affected by IVR pretreatment but affected by the complexity score of the case. Early postvitrectomy hemorrhage occurred less frequently in the IVR group than in the control group (P<0.001), Early visual recovery was better in the IVR group than in the control group (P=0.03). However, there were no significant differences in the development of late recurrent VH, NVG, recurrent retinal detachment, and final visual outcome. IVR pretreatment is a safe and effective adjunct to vitrectomy in reducing intraoperative and early postvitrectomy bleeding and should be suggested in young PDR patients.

Physical activity has the potential to counteract this debilitating outcome, however, it is elusive if high-intensity strength training included in conventional treatment may improve results. Therefore, we randomly assigned 22 PD patients (74 ± 9 yr) to conventional rehabilitation with or without maximal strength training (MST) performed as leg press and chest press at ~90% of one repetition maximum (1RM), five times per week for 4 wk.

Supra-total glioblastoma resection has gained growing attention with regard to superior long-term disease control. However, aggressive onco-surgical approaches-geared beyond conventional gross total resections (GTR)-are limited by the impairment of adjacent eloquent areas at risk that may entail severe postoperative functional morbidity. Against this backdrop we analyzed our institutional database with regard to potential survival benefits of anterior temporal lobectomy as a paradigm for supra-total resection in patients with precisely temporal-located, non-eloquent glioblastoma. Between 2012 and 2017, 38 patients with isolated temporal glioblastoma underwent GTR or temporal lobectomy at the authors' institution. Both groups of differing resection modalities were compared with regard to postoperative Karnofsky performance score (KPS), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Patients with temporal lobectomy exhibited significantly superior median KPS at the 12 months follow-up compared to the GTR group (median KPS of 80 vs. 60, p = 0.04). Temporal lobectomy was associated with significantly prolonged PFS (p = 0.005) and OS (p = 0.002) coming up to 15 months (95% CI 9.7-22.1) and 23 months (95% CI 14.8-34.5) compared to 7 months (95% CI 3.3-8.3) and 11 months (95% CI 9.2-17.9) for the GTR group.

Gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) originates from placental tissue and exhibits the potential for invasion and metastasis. Gene alterations in GTN have not been extensively studied because of a lack of qualified tumor specimens after chemotherapy. GTN has a rapid growth rate and is highly metastatic, which makes circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) sequencing a promising modality for gene profiling. Accordingly, in this study, we performed targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) of 559 tumor-associated genes using circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) collected prior to chemotherapy from 11 patients with GTN. All sequenced genes were associated with oncogenesis, progression, and targeted therapy. The average cfDNA level was 0.43 ± 0.22 ng/μL.

{"id": 43, "data": "Efficacy and Tolerability of Pitavastatin Versus Pitavastatin/Fenofibrate in High-risk Korean Patients with Mixed Dyslipidemia: A Multicenter, Randomized, Double-blinded, Parallel, Therapeutic Confirmatory Clinical Trial. Dyslipidemia is an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Statins are known to effectively reduce not only low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level but also death and nonfatal myocardial infarction due to coronary heart disease. The risk for CVD from atherogenic dyslipidemia persists when elevated triglyceride (TG) and reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels are not controlled with statin therapy. Therefore, statin/fenofibrate combination therapy is more effective in reducing CVD risk. Here, we assessed the efficacy and tolerability of pitavastatin/fenofibrate combination therapy in patients with mixed dyslipidemia and a high risk for CVD. This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, therapeutic-confirmatory clinical trial evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of fixed-dose combination therapy with pitavastatin/fenofibrate 2/160 mg in Korean patients with a high risk for CVD and a controlled LDL-C level (<100 mg/dL) and a TG level of 150-500 mg/dL after a run-in period with pitavastatin 2 mg alone. In the 8-week main study, 347 eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive pitavastatin 2 mg with or without fenofibrate 160 mg after a run-in period. In the extension study, patients with controlled LDL-C and non-HDL-C (<130 mg/dL) levels were included after the completion of the main study. All participants in the extension study received the pitavastatin/fenofibrate combination therapy for 16 weeks for the assessment of the tolerability of long-term treatment. The difference in the mean percentage change in non-HDL-C from baseline to week 8 between the combination therapy and monotherapy groups was -12.45% (95% CI, -17.18 to -7.72), and the combination therapy was associated with a greater reduction in non-HDL-C. The changes in lipid profile, including apolipoproteins, fibrinogen, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein from baseline to weeks 4 and 8 were statistically significant with combination therapy compared to monotherapy at all time points. Furthermore, the rates of achievement of non-HDL-C and apolipoprotein B targets at week 8 in the combination therapy and monotherapy groups were 88.30% versus 77.98% (P = 0.0110) and 78.94% versus 68.45% (P = 0.0021), respectively. The combination therapy was well tolerated, with a safety profile similar to that of statin monotherapy. In these Korean patients with mixed dyslipidemia and a high risk for CVD, combination therapy with pitavastatin/fenofibrate was associated with a greater reduction in non-HDL-C compared with that with pitavastatin monotherapy, and a significantly improvement in other lipid levels. Moreover, the combination therapy was well tolerated, with a safety profile similar to that of statin monotherapy. Therefore, pitavastatin/fenofibrate combination therapy could be effective and well tolerated in patients with mixed dyslipidemia.

Severe postoperative pain (SPP) may occur after lumbar discectomy. To prevent SPP and reduce rescue opioid consumption, infiltration anaesthesia (IA) has been combined with general anaesthesia (GA). This study verified how GA combined with IA facilitated intra- and postoperative demand for opioids and affected the incidence of SPP in patients subjected to open lumbar discectomy. Ninety-nine patients undergoing lumbar discectomy under GA with Surgical Pleth Index (SPI)-guided fentanyl (FNT) administration were randomly assigned to receive IA combined with either 0.2% bupivacaine (BPV) or 0.2% ropivacaine (RPV) with FNT 50 μg and compared with controls (BF, RF, and C groups, respectively). Ninety-four patients were included in the final analysis. Adjusted according to SPI, total intraoperative FNT dosages did not differ between the study groups (p = 0.23). The proportion of patients who reported SPP was the highest in group C (41.9%) than in the RF (12.9%) and BF groups (31.3%) (p < 0.05).

Objectives: Integrative therapies have been incorporated increasingly into health and wellness in the United States in recent decades. Their potential benefits are under evaluation in various situations, including pain and symptom relief for cancer patients and survivors. This pilot study evaluated whether combining two integrative complementary approaches augments a patient's benefit by reducing postoperative stress, pain, anxiety, muscle tension, and fatigue compared with one integrative complementary approach alone. Design: Patients undergoing autologous tissue breast reconstruction were randomly assigned to one of two postoperative complementary alternative therapies for three consecutive days. All participants were observed for up to 3 months. Subjects: Forty-two participants were recruited from January 29, 2016 to July 11, 2018. Interventions: Twenty-one participants were randomly assigned to massage alone and 21 to massage and acupuncture. Outcome measures: Stress, anxiety, relaxation, nausea, fatigue, pain, and mood (score 0-10) were measured at enrollment before surgery and postoperative days 1, 2, and 3 before and after the intervention. Patient satisfaction was evaluated. Results: Stress decreased from baseline for both Massage-Only Group and Massage+Acupuncture Group after each treatment intervention. Change in stress score from baseline decreased significantly more in the Massage-Only Group at pretreatment and posttreatment (p = 0.03 and p = 0.04). After adjustment for baseline values, change in fatigue, anxiety, relaxation, nausea, pain, and mood scores did not differ between groups. When patients were asked whether they would recommend the study, 100% (19/19) of Massage-Only Group and 94% (17/18) of Massage+Acupuncture Group responded yes (p = 0.49). Conclusion: No additive beneficial effects were observed with addition of acupuncture to massage for pain, anxiety, relaxation, nausea, fatigue, and mood.

S44819, a selective GABAA α5 receptor antagonist, reduces tonic post-ischaemic inhibition of the peri-infarct cortex. S44819 improved stroke recovery in rodents and increased cortical excitability in a transcranial magnetic stimulation study in healthy volunteers. The Randomized Efficacy and Safety Trial of Oral GABAA α5 antagonist S44819 after Recent ischemic Event (RESTORE BRAIN) aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of S44819 for enhancing clinical recovery of patients with ischaemic stroke. RESTORE BRAIN was an international, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, multicentre phase 2 trial that evaluated the safety and efficacy of oral S44189 in patients with recent ischaemic stroke. The study was done in specialised stroke units in 92 actively recruiting centres in 14 countries: ten were European countries (Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Spain, and the UK) and four were non-European countries (Australia, Brazil, Canada, and South Korea). Patients aged 18-85 years with acute ischaemic stroke involving cerebral cortex (National Institute of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS] score 7-20) without previous disability were eligible for inclusion. Participants were randomly assigned to receive 150 mg S44819 twice a day, 300 mg S44819 twice a day, or placebo twice a day by a balanced, non-adaptive randomisation method with a 1:1:1 ratio. Treatment randomisation and allocation were centralised via the interactive web response system using computer-generated random sequences with a block size of 3. Blinding of treatment was achieved by identical appearance and taste of all sachets. Patients, investigators and individuals involved in the analysis of the trial were masked to group assignment. The primary endpoint was the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score 90 days from onset of treatment, evaluated by shift analysis (predefined main analysis) or by dichotomised analyses using 0-1 versus 2-6 and 0-2 versus 3-6 cutoffs (predefined secondary analysis). Secondary endpoints were the effects of S44819 on the NIHSS and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores, time needed to complete parts A and B of the Trail Making Test, and the Barthel index. Efficacy analyses were done on all patients who received at least one dose of treatment and had at least one mRS score taken after day 5 (specifically, on or after day 30).

The primary outcome was GDM incidence in the one-step compared to the two-approach. Pregnant women without a history of pregestational diabetes were offered screening for GDM at gestational age 24-28 weeks. Obese women, defined as having a BMI ≥30 kg/m 2 , as well as those with a history of a pregnancy complicated by GDM, a history of a macrosomic baby (>4000 g), or with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), were offered early screening at their initial prenatal visit, and screening was repeated at 24-28 weeks if initially normal. Women were excluded if they had pre-existing diabetes or had a history of bariatric surgery. Women who were eligible were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either the one-step or two-step approaches. A sample size of 142 women was planned per group. Women randomized to the one-step approach, after an overnight fast, were given a 2-h glucose tolerance test, which consisted of a 75-g glucose load.

Forty volunteers with moderate to severe chronic periodontitis were recruited, of which at least three sextants required periodontal therapy. At least one of the selected teeth had one site with a probing depth of ≥4 mm. The volunteers received the following three gels: a placebo, lidocaine/prilocaine (Oraqix®), or a liposomal lidocaine/prilocaine, which were applied to different sextants. Pain frequency was registered during treatment and the volunteers received a digital counter to register any painful or uncomfortable experiences. At the end of each session, the volunteers indicated their pain intensity using rating scales (NRS-101 and VRS-4). The volunteers had their hemodynamic parameters measured by a non-invasive digital monitor. Pain frequency/intensity did not show statistical difference between intervention groups.

We aimed to investigate the effectiveness of continuous antibiotic prophylaxis (CAP) in patients with JJ stent and tried to identify the group that could specifically benefit from CAP by a prospective randomized study. A prospective, randomized, controlled, non-blind, non-placebo study was performed in a single center.A total of 105 patients who underwent surgery with JJ stent (PNL, URS, pyeloplasty, UNC) were randomized into two groups. 53 patients in Group A received CAP and 52 patients in Group B were controlled without CAP, during the presence of a JJ stent. Patients with external stents, nephrostomy tubes, indwelling long-term urethral catheters were excluded. History of preoperative use of CAP and lower urinary tract symptoms were noted. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) was used as the initial choice of antibiotic however if there was a history of antibiotic resistance in previous urinary cultures, Nitrofurantoin was administrated. Urinary cultures were obtained before surgery and before stent extraction. JJ stents were sent to culture. Symptomatic febrile urinary tract infections with positive urine cultures (10 5  CFU on a clean catch or 10 3 with urethral catheterization) were compared between groups. Our study has some limitations; the study is the single-center, we did not follow-up of patients in terms of scar, there were low number of uncircumcised patients, multiple types of surgical procedures were performed. JJ stent is a frequently used instrument in children. Unfortunately, any randomized prospective on antibiotics administration while using a JJ stent is not available in the current literature. We hope our research will contribute to the existing literature and cause a significant change in clinical practice. The mean age among all patients was 4.8 ± 3.9 years. The mean length of time jj stents stayed inside was 16.34 ± 6.45 days in group A and 15.29 ± 7.71 days in group B. The incidence of febrile urinary tract infections with CAP was significantly reduced (3.8% vs. 19% (p 0.015)). Multivariate regression analysis revealed that a positive history for preop febrile urinary tract infections and/or LUTS has a significantly higher association with the incidence of febrile urinary tract infecitons.

We assessed the safety of avapritinib and provide evidence-based guidance on management of avapritinib-associated adverse events (AEs), including cognitive effects and intracranial bleeding. We performed a post hoc analysis of data from a two-part, single-arm dose escalation/expansion phase I study (NAVIGATOR; NCT02508532) in patients with U/M GISTs treated with oral avapritinib 30-600 mg once daily. The primary endpoints were safety and tolerability; the impact of dose modification (interruption and/or reduction) on progression-free survival (PFS) was a secondary endpoint. Efficacy analyses were limited to patients who started avapritinib at 300 mg (approved dose). Of 250 patients enrolled in the study, 74.0% presented with KIT mutation and 24.8% presented with PDGFRA exon 18-mutation; 66.8% started avapritinib at 300 mg. The most common treatment-related AEs (any grade) were nausea (59.2%), fatigue (50.0%), periorbital edema (42.0%), anemia (39.2%), diarrhea (36.0%), vomiting (36.0%), and increased lacrimation (30.8%). No treatment-related deaths occurred. Among 167 patients starting on 300 mg avapritinib, all-cause cognitive effects rate (grade 1-2) was 37.0% in all patients and 52.0% in patients ≥65 years. Cognitive effects improved to a lower grade more quickly with dose modification (1.3-3.1 weeks) than without (4.9-7.6 weeks). Median PFS was 11.4 months with dose modification and 7.2 months without. Tolerability-guided dose modification of avapritinib is an effective strategy for managing AEs in patients with GISTs. Early recognition of adverse events and tailored dose modification appear to be effective approaches for managing treatment-related adverse events and maintaining patients on avapritinib.

Bruxism is a parafunctional habit, usually performed in sleep, by rhythmic and involuntary teeth being squeezed or squeaked. The most common methods of treatment are the use of occlusal splints. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of occlusal splinting with botulinum toxin administration in the treatment of TMJ pain. For this purpose, 40 patients with bruxism were divided into two groups and one group was treated with occlusal splint and the other group received masseter muscle botulinum toxin injection. Then, the participants in both groups were evaluated in terms of pain, functional movement, and maximum bite force change at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months. Mann-Whitney U test was used to examine the differences between two independent groups. While Friedman test was used for differences between dependent groups, the Wilcoxon test was used for the differences between two repetitive measurements.

{"id": 68, "data": "A clinical and immunological study of phototoxic regimen of ultraviolet A for treatment of alopecia areata: a randomized controlled clinical trial. Background: Various therapeutic agents have been described for alopecia areata but none is satisfactory. The use of ultraviolet A phototherapy in phototoxic regimens has emerged lately with promising results. Objective: To determine the efficacy and safety of phototoxic regimen of psoralen ultraviolet A (PUVA) in comparison to conventional therapy with intralesional corticosteroids in patients with alopecia areata. Methods: In this randomized controlled clinical trial, 40 patients were randomized to either phototoxic regimen of psoralen ultraviolet A group or potent intralesional corticosteroids group for three months. Study ended at six months. The primary outcome was treatment success: sustained regrowth of hair in ≥80% of the affected areas at six months. Tissue cytokines were assessed at zero and three months. Results: At six months, treatment success was achieved by 45% of patients, similarly in both groups. Tissue cytokine expression correlated well with clinical response. Conclusion: Phototoxic regimen of topical PUVA deserves a place among therapeutic tools used in management of alopecia areata especially in more extensive conditions where intralesional corticosteroids would not be suitable.

{"id": 69, "data": "Efficacy of a Self-Help Web-Based Recovery Training in Improving Sleep in Workers: Randomized Controlled Trial in the General Working Population. Sleep complaints are among the most prevalent health concerns, especially among workers, which may lead to adverse effects on health and work. Internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (iCBT-I) offers the opportunity to deliver effective solutions on a large scale. The efficacy of iCBT-I for clinical samples has been demonstrated in recent meta-analyses, and there is evidence that iCBT-I is effective in the working population with severe sleep complaints. However, to date, there is limited evidence from randomized controlled trials that iCBT-I could also be an effective tool for universal prevention among the general working population regardless of symptom severity. Although increasing evidence suggests that negatively toned cognitive activity may be a key factor for the development and maintenance of insomnia, little is known about how iCBT-I improves sleep by reducing presleep cognitive activity. This study aimed to examine the efficacy of a self-help internet-delivered recovery training, based on principles of iCBT-I tailored to the work-life domain, among the general working population. General and work-related cognitive activities were investigated as potential mediators of the intervention's effect. A sample of 177 workers were randomized to receive either the iCBT-I (n=88) or controls (n=89). The intervention is a Web-based training consisting of six 1-week modules. As the training was self-help, participants received nothing but technical support via email. Web-based self-report assessments were scheduled at baseline, at 8 weeks, and at 6 months following randomization. The primary outcome was insomnia severity. Secondary outcomes included measures of mental health and work-related health and cognitive activity. In an exploratory analysis, general and work-related cognitive activities, measured as worry and work-related rumination, were investigated as mediators. Analysis of the linear mixed effects model showed that, relative to controls, participants who received iCBT-I reported significantly lower insomnia severity scores at postintervention (between-group mean difference -4.36; 95% CI -5.59 to - 3.03; Cohen d=0.97) and at 6-month follow-up (between-group difference: -3.64; 95% CI -4.89 to -2.39; Cohen d=0.86). The overall test of group-by-time interaction was significant (P<.001). Significant differences, with small-to-large effect sizes, were also detected for cognitive activity and for mental and work-related health, but not for absenteeism. Mediation analysis demonstrated that work-related rumination (indirect effect: a1b1=-0.80; SE=0.34; 95% boot CI -1.59 to -0.25) and worry (indirect effect: a2b2=-0.37; SE=0.19; 95% boot CI -0.85 to -0.09) mediate the intervention's effect on sleep. A self-help Web-based recovery training, grounded in the principles of iCBT-I, can be effective in the general working population, both short and long term. Work-related rumination may be a particularly crucial mediator of the intervention's effect, suggesting that tailoring interventions to the workplace, including components to reduce the work-related cognitive activity, might be important when designing recovery interventions for workers.

{"id": 70, "data": "Impact of Serum Bicarbonate Levels on Muscle Mass and Kidney Function in Pre-Dialysis Chronic Kidney Disease Patients. Treatment of metabolic acidosis to target the higher serum bicarbonate level than guideline recommendation may downregulate muscle protein degradation and improve renal function among chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. We conducted a study to test the effects of increased serum bicarbonate level on muscle parameters, nutrition, and renal function in pre-dialysis CKD patients. This was a randomized, controlled study. CKD stage 3-4 patients with serum HCO3- <22 mEq/L were randomized to either receive oral sodium bicarbonate with high target bicarbonate level of 25 ± 1 or standard level of 22 ± 1 mEq/L as control group using protocol-based titration of dosage adjustment. The changes of muscle mass measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), muscle strength by hand grip dynamometer, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) using CKD-Epidemiology Collaboration equation, nutritional markers, and muscle-related biomarkers were determined. Data at baseline and after 4 months of sodium bicarbonate supplementation were compared between groups using Student t test or chi-square test as appropriate. Forty-two patients completed the study (n = 21 per group). The mean age and eGFR were 61.2 ± 9.8 years and 32.4 ± 14.1 mL/min respectively. Serum bicarbonate levels at baseline were 21.0 ± 2.1 mEq/L. Baseline data including sex, diabetes, serum bicarbonate level, creatinine, and blood pressure were similar. After 4 months of treatment, the average serum bicarbonate levels in both groups were 24.0 ± 1.4 and 20.7 ± 2.3 mEq/L (p < 0.001). Both BIA-derived total-body muscle mass and appendicular lean balance were increased at 4 months in the higher bicarbonate group (26.0 ± 5.3 to 26.7 ± 5.5 kg, p = 0.04 and 19.8 ± 4.1 to 20.7 ± 4.4 kg, p = 0.06, respectively) despite comparable body weight and protein intake. Patients in the high bicarbonate group had a significant reduction of plasma myostatin levels, a surrogate of muscle degradation, at the study exit after adjusting for baseline values (-3,137.8; 95% CI -6,235.3 to -40.4 pg/mL, p= 0.04), but unaltered insulin-like growth factor-1 level, as the mediator of muscle cell growth, (141 [106-156] to 110 [87-144] ng/mL, p = 0.13) compared to the control group. Muscle strength, eGFR as well as serum prealbumin were not significantly different between 2 groups (p > 0.05). Neither worsening hypertension nor congestive heart failure was found throughout the study.

Aims: This study design article aims to describe a research study focused on evaluating the use of the Infant-Toddler Checklist to identify children at 18 months with early communication difficulties, and to study the ComAlong Toddler intervention for parents to support their child's communication development. Background: Communication disorders are a common public health problem affecting up to 20% of children. Evidence points to the importance of early detection and intervention to improve young children's communicative abilities and decrease developmental delay. Early identification of communication difficulties is possible with instruments such as Infant-Toddler Checklist. The ComAlong Toddler intervention is tailored to the needs of parents of young children with communication delay before definitive diagnosis. The parents are provided with guidance in communication enhancing strategies during home visit and five group sessions. Methods: The study uses a prospective cohort design. Children were consecutively recruited during 2015-2017, and data will be collected 2015-2023. The screening was performed at the child health centre through use of the Infant-Toddler Checklist. An assessment and first consultation were then performed by a speech and language therapist for children with suspected communication delay according to the screen as well as for children referred for other reasons before the age of 2.5 years. Children with confirmed communication delay were randomised between two interventions: the ComAlong Toddler parental course or a telephone follow-up. Outcome measures include child communication and language skills and use of augmentative and alternative communication. To gain insight into the participants' perspectives, surveys have been collected from parents. Conclusion: The study will provide information regarding identification and intervention for 18-month old children with communication delay.

Weight loss has been identified as a negative prognostic factor in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, but there is no evidence regarding whether a high-caloric diet increases survival. Therefore, we sought to evaluate the efficacy of a high-caloric fatty diet (HCFD) for increasing survival. A 1:1 randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, double-blinded trial (LIPCAL-ALS study) was conducted between February 2015 and September 2018. Patients were followed up at 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 months after randomization. The study was performed at 12 sites of the clinical and scientific network of German motor neuron disease centers (ALS/MND-NET). Eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either HCFD (405kcal/day, 100% fat) or placebo in addition to riluzole (100mg/day). The primary endpoint was survival time, defined as time to death or time to study cutoff date. Two hundred one patients (80 female, 121 male, age = 62.4 ± 10.8 years) were included. The confirmatory analysis of the primary outcome survival showed a survival probability of 0.39 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.27-0.51) in the placebo group and 0.37 (95% CI = 0.25-0.49) in the HCFD group, both after 28 months (point in time of the last event).

Method Eight participants were recruited for each of 7 consecutive cohorts for a total of 56 participants. Participants completed 60 hr of aphasia therapy, including 15 hr of VNeST. Two experienced speech-language pathologists delivered the treatment. To promote treatment fidelity, the study team developed a detailed manual of procedures and fidelity checklists, completed role plays to standardize treatment administration, and video-recorded all treatment sessions for review. To assess protocol adherence during treatment delivery, trained research assistants not involved in the treatment reviewed video recordings of a subset of randomly selected VNeST treatment sessions and completed the fidelity checklists. This process was completed for 32 participants representing 2 early cohorts and 2 later cohorts, which allowed for measurement of protocol adherence over time. Percent accuracy of protocol adherence was calculated across clinicians, cohorts, and study condition (intensive vs. distributed therapy). Results The fidelity procedures were sufficient to promote and verify a high level of adherence to the treatment protocol across clinicians, cohorts, and study condition.

High plasma levels of N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) indicate increased probability of congestive heart failure (CHF) and atrial fibrillation (AF) and are associated with poor prognosis. We aimed to describe the clinical and echocardiographic characteristics of a population of individuals aged 75/76 years old with NT-proBNP ≥900 ng/L without previously known CHF or AF. All individuals aged 75/76 years in the Stockholm region were randomised to a screening study for AF. Half of them were invited to screening. Of those invited, 49.5% agreed to participate.

{"id": 84, "data": "Vitamin D3 Supplementation in Diarrhea-Predominant Irritable Bowel Syndrome Patients: The Effects on Symptoms Improvement, Serum Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone, and Interleukin-6 - A Randomized Clinical Trial. This study aimed to evaluate whether vitamin D deficiency is associated with the severity of symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients. Stress and gut inflammation can increase the serum level of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), leading to a change in bowel movements. The aim of this study was to evaluate the anti-inflammatory and psychological effects of vitamin D3 supplementation on the symptom improvement of patients with a diarrhea-predominant form of IBS (IBS-D). Eighty-eight IBS-D patients (age: 18-65 years) based on Rome IV criteria who suffered from vitamin D deficiency and/or insufficiency were enrolled in this randomized, placebo-controlled trial from February 2017 to May 2018 at Rasoul-e-Akram Hospital, Tehran, Iran. Participants were randomly divided into two groups. The intervention group received 50,000 IU vitamin D3 weekly and the control group received a placebo for 9 weeks. All patients received Mebeverine 135 mg twice a day besides supplementation. The IBS Severity Score System (IBS-SSS), serum 25(OH) vitamin D3, CRH, and IL-6 were measured before and after interventions. Seventy-four patients completed the study. The severity of IBS symptoms (p < 0.01) and IL-6 (p = 0.02) decreased significantly in the intervention group as compared to the control group, but there was no significant difference in the serum level of CRH. Also, in the treatment group, IBS-SSS and IL-6 were significantly reduced at the end of the study from baseline (p < 0.01 and p < 0.03, respectively). Our findings indicate that vitamin D3 supplementation can modulate the serum level of CRH and IL-6 and can improve symptoms in IBS-D patients. Vitamin D3 supplementation should be considered in IBS-D patients who suffer from vitamin D deficiency and/or insufficiency. Ziele: Diese Studie untersucht den Zusammenhang zwischen Vitamin-D-Mangel und dem Schweregrad der Symptome von Patienten mit Reizdarmsyndrom (irritable bowel syndrome, IBS). Stress und Darmentzündung können erhöhte Serumkonzentrationen von Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone (CRH) und Interleukin-6 (IL-6) zur Folge haben, die zu Veränderungen des Stuhlverhaltens führen. Mit der vorliegenden Studie sollten die entzün­dungshemmenden und psychischen Effekte einer Vitamin-D3-Supplementierung auf die Symptomverbesse­rung von Patienten mit diarrhödominantem Reizdarmsyndrom (diarrhea-predominant form of IBS, IBS-D) beurteilt werden. Methoden: In diese randomisierte, placebokontrollierte Studie, die von Februar 2017 bis Mai 2018 am Rasoul-e-Akram Hospital in Teheran, Iran, durchgeführt wurde, wurden 88 Patienten mit IBS-D gemäß den Rom-IV-Kriterien (Alter: 18–65 Jahre) aufgenommen. Die Studienteilnehmer wurden randomisiert einer von zwei Gruppen zugeordnet. Die Interventionsgruppe erhielt wöchentlich über 9 Wochen 50’000 IU Vitamin D3, und die Kontrollgruppe erhielt ein Placebo. Alle Patienten erhielten neben der Supplementierung zweimal täglich Mebeverin 135 mg. Vor und nach der Intervention erfolgten eine Beurteilung der Krankheitsschwere gemäß IBS Severity Score System (IBS-SSS) sowie eine Bestimmung der Serumkonzentrationen von 25(OH)-Vitamin D3, CRH und IL-6. Ergebnisse: Vierundsiebzig Teilnehmer schlossen die Studienteilnahme ab. Der Schweregrad der IBS-Symptome (p < 0,01) und die IL-6-Serumkonzentration(p = 0,02) gingen in der Interventionsgruppe im Vergleich zur Kontrollgruppe signifikant zurück, während bei der CRH-Serumkonzentration kein signifikanter Unterschied zu beobachten war. Ferner zeigte sich in der Behandlungsgruppe bei Studienende ein signifikanter Rückgang des IBS-SSS und der IL-6-Serumkonzentration gegenüber Studienbeginn (p < 0,01 bzw. p < 0,03). Schlussfolgerung: Unsere Ergebnisse zeigen, dass eine Vitamin-D3-Supplementierung die Serumspiegel von CRH und IL-6 verändern und die Symptome von Patienten mit IBS-D verbessern kann.

Treatment switching adjustment methods are often used to adjust for switching in oncology randomized controlled trials (RCTs). In this exploratory analysis, we apply these methods to adjust for treatment changes in the setting of an RCT followed by an extension study in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. The CLARITY trial evaluated cladribine tablets versus placebo over 96 weeks. In the 96-week CLARITY Extension, patients who received placebo in CLARITY received cladribine tablets; patients who received cladribine tablets in CLARITY were re-randomized to placebo or cladribine tablets. End points were time to first qualifying relapse (FQR) and time to 3- and 6-month confirmed disability progression (3mCDP, 6mCDP). We aimed to compare the effectiveness of cladribine tablets with placebo over CLARITY and the extension. The rank-preserving structural failure time model (RPSFTM) and iterative parameter estimation (IPE) were used to estimate what would have happened if patients had received placebo in CLARITY and the extension versus patients that received cladribine tablets and switched to placebo. To gauge whether treatment effect waned after the 96 weeks of CLARITY, we compared hazard ratios (HRs) from the adjustment analysis with HRs from CLARITY. The RPSFTM resulted in an HR of 0.48 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.36-0.62] for FQR, 0.62 (95% CI 0.46-0.84) for 3mCDP and 0.62 (95% CI 0.44-0.88) for 6mCDP. IPE algorithm results were similar.

Hyperactivity of the IL-23/IL-17 axis is central to plaque psoriasis pathogenesis. Secukinumab, a fully human mAb that selectively inhibits IL-17A, is approved for treatment of psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis. Secukinumab improves the complete spectrum of psoriasis manifestations, with durable clinical responses beyond 5 years of treatment. In the feed-forward model of plaque chronicity, IL-17A has been hypothesized as the key driver of pathogenic gene expression by lesional keratinocytes, but in vivo evidence in human subjects is lacking. We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (NCT01537432) of patients receiving secukinumab at the clinically approved dose up to 12 weeks. We then correlated plaque and nonlesional skin transcriptomic profiles with histopathologic and clinical measures of efficacy. After 12 weeks of treatment, secukinumab reversed plaque histopathology in the majority of patients and modulated thousands of transcripts. Suppression of the IL-23/IL-17 axis by secukinumab was evident at week 1 and continued through week 12, including reductions in levels of the upstream cytokine IL-23, the drug target IL-17A, and downstream targets, including β-defensin 2.

This study assessed the relationship between distress, severity and frequency of attenuated psychotic symptoms in individuals meeting Ultra High Risk (UHR) criteria, both at baseline and over time.

At baseline a combined total of 592 UHR participants (mean age 19.9; males, 53.9%) from two studies were assessed using a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Change over time from this baseline point was assessed using latent growth curve (LGC) models, based on participants from one of the studies. Distress associated with psychotic symptom was shown to be a separate psychological construct from severity and frequency. Distress was also significantly associated with severity but not frequency. Longitudinal LGC models with 244 participants showed that distress, severity and frequency all reduced over six months, although the rate of distress reduction varied across symptom type. Non-bizarre ideas (NBI) were more distressing and had the fastest rate of distress reduction over time. The baseline distress for some symptoms also strongly predicted the symptom severity change over time, suggesting that distress may cause change in the UHR criteria for unusual thought content (UTC) and NBI symptoms. CBT was not shown to be significantly different from treatment as usual (TAU) in its effect on distress. However, distress reduces over time, particularly in the first 3 months after presentation.

As part of its diverse portfolio, the Schistosomiasis Consortium for Operational Research and Evaluation (SCORE) included two cluster-randomized trials evaluating interventions that could potentially lead to interruption of schistosomiasis transmission (elimination) in areas of Africa with low prevalence and intensity of infection. These studies, conducted in Zanzibar and Côte d'Ivoire, demonstrated that multiyear mass drug administration (MDA) with praziquantel failed to interrupt the transmission of urogenital schistosomiasis, even when provided biannually and/or supplemented by small-scale implementation of additional interventions. Other SCORE activities related to elimination included a feasibility and acceptability assessment of test-treat-track-test-treat (T5) strategies and mathematical modeling. Future evaluations of interventions to eliminate schistosomiasis should recognize the difficulties inherent in conducting randomized controlled trials on elimination and in measuring small changes where baseline prevalence is low. Highly sensitive and specific diagnostic tests for use in very low-prevalence areas for schistosomiasis are not routinely available, which complicates accurate measurement of infection rates and assessment of changes resulting from interventions in these settings. Although not encountered in these two studies, as prevalence and intensity decrease, political and community commitment to population-wide MDA may decrease. Because of this potential problem, SCORE developed and funded the T5 strategy implemented in Egypt, Kenya, and Tanzania. It is likely that focal MDA campaigns, along with more targeted approaches, including a T5 strategy and snail control, will need to be supplemented with the provision of clean water and sanitation and behavior change communications to achieve interruption of schistosome transmission.", "label": [[1680, 1964, "B"], [44, 88, "X"], [360, 422, "P"], [298, 356, "X"]]}

{"id": 106, "data": "ICON: a randomized phase IIb study evaluating immunogenic chemotherapy combined with ipilimumab and nivolumab in patients with metastatic hormone receptor positive breast cancer. Immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors (CPI) targeting PD-1 or CTLA-4 has emerged as an important treatment modality for several cancer forms. In hormone receptor positive breast cancer (HR + BC), this therapeutic approach is largely unexplored. We have started a clinical trial, ICON (CA209-9FN), evaluating CPI combined with selected chemotherapy in patients with metastatic HR + BC. The tumor lymphocyte infiltration is predictive for the effect of chemotherapy in BC. In ICON, we use anthracycline, which are considered as immunogenic chemotherapy, and low-dose cyclophosphamide, which has been reported to counter immunosuppressive cells. ICON is a randomized exploratory phase IIb study evaluating the safety and efficacy of combining nivolumab (nivo; anti-PD-1) and ipilimumab (ipi; anti-CTLA-4) with chemotherapy in subjects with metastatic HR + BC. Primary objectives are aassessment of toxicity and progression-free survival. The trial will enrol 75 evaluable subjects, randomized 2:3 into two arms (A:B). Patients in Arm A receive only chemotherapy, i.e. pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD 20 mg/m 2  intravenously every 2nd week) + cyclophosphamide (cyclo; 50 mg per day, first 2 weeks in each 4 week cycle). Patients in Arm B receive PLD + cyclo + ipilimumab (1 mg intravenously every 6th week) + nivolumab (240 mg intravenously every 2nd week). Patients in arm A will be offered ipi + nivo after disease progression. ICON is among the first clinical trials combining chemotherapy with PD-1 and CTLA-4 blockade, and the first in BC. There is a strong preclinical rationale for exploring if anthracyclines, which are considered to induce immunogenic cell death, synergize with CPI, and for combining PD-1 and CTLA-4 blockade, as these checkpoints are important in different phases of the immune response. If the ICON trial suggests acceptable safety and provide a signal of clinical efficacy, further studies are warranted. The cross-over patients from Arm A receiving ipilimumab/nivolumab without concomitant chemotherapy represent the first BC cohort receiving this therapy. The ICON trial includes a series of translational sub-projects addressing clinically important knowledge gaps. These studies may uncover biomarkers or mechanisms of efficacy and resistance, thereby informing the development of novel combinatory regimes and of personalised biomarker-based therapy.

Artemisinin resistance is threatening malaria control. We aimed to develop and test a human model of artemisinin-resistant (ART-R) Plasmodium falciparum to evaluate the efficacy of drugs against ART-R malaria. We conducted 2 sequential phase 1, single-centre, open-label clinical trials at Q-Pharm, Brisbane, Australia, using the induced blood-stage malaria (IBSM) model, whereby healthy participants are intravenously inoculated with blood-stage parasites. In a pilot study, participants were inoculated (Day 0) with approximately 2,800 viable P. falciparum ART-R parasites. In a comparative study, participants were randomised to receive approximately 2,800 viable P. falciparum ART-R (Day 0) or artemisinin-sensitive (ART-S) parasites (Day 1). In both studies, participants were administered a single approximately 2 mg/kg oral dose of artesunate (AS; Day 9). Primary outcomes were safety, ART-R parasite infectivity, and parasite clearance. In the pilot study, 2 participants were enrolled between April 27, 2017, and September 12, 2017, and included in final analyses (males n = 2 [100%], mean age = 26 years [range, 23-28 years]). In the comparative study, 25 participants were enrolled between October 26, 2017, and October 18, 2018, of whom 22 were inoculated and included in final analyses (ART-R infected participants: males n = 7 [53.8%], median age = 22 years [range, 18-40 years]; ART-S infected participants: males n = 5 [55.6%], median age = 28 years [range, 22-35 years]). In both studies, all participants inoculated with ART-R parasites became parasitaemic. A total of 36 adverse events were reported in the pilot study and 277 in the comparative study. Common adverse events in both studies included headache, pyrexia, myalgia, nausea, and chills; none were serious. Seven participants experienced transient severe falls in white cell counts and/or elevations in liver transaminase levels which were considered related to malaria. Additionally, 2 participants developed ventricular extrasystoles that were attributed to unmasking of a predisposition to benign fever-induced tachyarrhythmia. In the comparative study, parasite clearance half-life after AS was significantly longer for ART-R infected participants (n = 13, 6.5 hours; 95% confidence interval [CI] 6.3-6.7 hours) compared with ART-S infected participants (n = 9, 3.2 hours; 95% CI 3.0-3.3 hours; p < 0.001). The main limitation of this study was that the ART-R and ART-S parasite strains did not share the same genetic background. We developed the first (to our knowledge) human model of ART-R malaria.

The goal of the present study was to examine the effects of a Tie2 activator, AKB-9778, on IOP and outflow function. AKB-9778 effects on IOP was evaluated in humans, rabbits, and mice. Localization studies of vascular endothelial protein tyrosine phosphatase (VE-PTP), the target of AKB-9778 and a negative regulator of Tie2, were performed in human and mouse eyes. Mechanistic studies were carried out in mice, monitoring AKB-9778 effects on outflow facility, Tie2 phosphorylation, and filtration area of SC. AKB-9778 lowered IOP in patients treated subcutaneously for diabetic eye disease.

Veterans Affairs (VA) has rolled out a holistic, multicomponent Whole Health care model nationwide, yet no pragmatic trials have been conducted in real-world clinical settings to compare its effectiveness against other evidence-based approaches for chronic pain management in veterans. We describe the adaptation of the first large pragmatic randomized controlled trial of the Whole Health model for chronic pain care for diverse VA clinical settings. Informed by the Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Systems implementation framework, we conducted qualitative semistructured interviews to obtain feedback on trial design from VA leadership, frontline clinicians, and veterans with chronic pain at 5 VA enrollment sites. Next, we convened in-person evidence-based quality improvement (EBQI) meetings with study stakeholders (including frontline clinicians and administrators) at each site to discuss study design; review interview themes; and identify site-specific barriers, facilitators, and approaches to implementation. Ethnographic observations from EBQI meetings provided additional insight into implementation strategies. Seventy-four veteran and VA staff stakeholders were interviewed; 71 stakeholders participated in EBQI meetings. At each site, unique clinical contexts and varying resources for Whole Health and pain care delivery affected plans for trial implementation. We present examples of local adaptations that emerged through the formative evaluation process to facilitate implementation and yield a more pragmatic trial design.

The challenges posed by the spread of COVID-19 disease through aerosols have compelled anesthesiologists to modify their airway management practices. Devices such as barrier boxes are being considered as potential adjuncts to full PPE's to limit the aerosol spread. Usage of the barrier box raises concerns of delay in time to intubate (TTI). We designed our study to determine if using a barrier box with glidescope delays TTI within acceptable parameters to make relevant clinical conclusions. Seventy-eight patients were enrolled in this prospective non-inferiority controlled trial and were randomly allocated to either group C (without the barrier box) or the study group BB (using barrier box).

We used an unpaired two-sample single-sided t-test to test our non- inferiority hypothesis (H 0: Mean TTI diff ≥15 s, H A: Mean TTI diff < 15 s). Secondary endpoints include the number of attempts at intubation, lowest oxygen saturation during induction, and the need for bag-mask ventilation. Mean TTI in group C was 42 s (CI 19.2 to 64.8) vs. 52.1 s (CI 26.1 to 78) in group BB. The difference in mean TTI was 10.1 s (CI -∞ to 14.9). We rejected the null hypothesis and concluded with 95% confidence that the difference of the mean TTI between the groups is less than < 15 s (95% CI -∞ to 14.9,p = 0.0461). Our induction times were comparable (67.7 vs. 65.9 s).100% of our patients were intubated on the first attempt in both groups. None of our patients needed rescue breaths.

The DM trial aimed to examine whether a low-fat dietary pattern would reduce the risk of invasive breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and, secondarily, coronary heart disease (CHD), with various other health outcomes also considered. The DM trial is a randomized controlled trial conducted at 40 centers in the US, among 48,835 postmenopausal women aged 50-79 y with baseline intake of ≥32% energy from fat. Participants were randomly assigned to a low-fat dietary pattern intervention group or to a usual-diet comparison group, during 1993-1998. Intervention goals were to reduce fat intake from ∼35% to 20% of total energy, in conjunction with increasing vegetables and fruit to 5 servings/d and grains to 6 servings/d. Over an 8.5-y (median) intervention period, intervention and comparison group differences included lower fat by 8-10%, and higher carbohydrate by 8-10%, of total energy, in conjunction with higher consumption of vegetables, fruit, and grains.

Patients with scarred vocal folds, whether congenitally or after phonosurgery, often exhibit dysphonia that negatively affects daily life and is difficult to treat. The autologous adipose tissue-derived stromal vascular fraction (ADSVF) is a readily accessible source of cells with angiogenic, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and regenerative properties. To evaluate the feasibility and tolerability of local injections of autologous ADSVF in patients with scarred vocal folds. CELLCORDES (Innovative Treatment for Scarred Vocal Cords by Local Injection of Autologous Stromal Vascular Fraction) is a prospective, open-label, single-arm, single-center, nonrandomized controlled trial with a 12-month follow-up and patient enrollment from April 1, 2016, to June 30, 2017. Eight patients with severe dysphonia attributable to vocal fold scarring associated with a congenital malformation or resulting from microsurgical sequelae (voice handicap index score >60 of 120) completed the study. Data analysis was performed from September 1, 2018, to January 1, 2019. Injection of ADSVF into 1 or 2 vocal folds. The primary outcomes were feasibility and the number and severity of adverse events associated with ADSVF-based therapy. The secondary outcomes were changes in vocal assessment, videolaryngostroboscopy, self-evaluation of dysphonia, and quality of life at 1, 6, and 12 months after cell therapy. Seven women and 1 man (mean [SD] age, 44.6 [10.4] years) were enrolled in this study. Adverse events associated with liposuction and ADSVF injection occurred; most of them resolved spontaneously. One patient received minor treatment to drain local bruising, and another experienced a minor contour defect at the liposuction site. At 12 months, the voice handicap index score was improved in all patients, with a mean (SD) improvement from baseline of 40.1 (21.5) points. Seven patients (88%) were considered to be responders, defined as improvement by 18 points or more in the voice handicap index score (the minimum clinically important difference).

To evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of early endovenous ablation of superficial venous reflux in patients with venous leg ulceration. Between October 24, 2013, and September 27, 2016, the EVRA randomized clinical trial enrolled 450 participants (450 legs) with venous leg ulceration of less than 6 months' duration and superficial venous reflux. Initially, 6555 patients were assessed for eligibility, and 6105 were excluded for reasons including ulcer duration greater than 6 months, healed ulcer by the time of randomization, deep venous occlusive disease, and insufficient superficial venous reflux to warrant ablation therapy, among others. A total of 426 of 450 participants (94.7%) from the vascular surgery departments of 20 hospitals in the United Kingdom were included in the analysis for ulcer recurrence. Surgeons, participants, and follow-up assessors were not blinded to the treatment group. Data were analyzed from August 11 to November 4, 2019. Patients were randomly assigned to receive compression therapy with early endovenous ablation within 2 weeks of randomization (early intervention, n = 224) or compression with deferred endovenous treatment of superficial venous reflux (deferred intervention, n = 226). Endovenous modality and strategy were left to the preference of the treating clinical team. The primary outcome for the extended phase was time to first ulcer recurrence.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, debilitating autoimmune condition characterized by joint synovial inflammation. Current treatments include methotrexate (MTX), biologic agents, and Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors. However, these agents are not efficacious in all patients and there are concerns regarding side effects and risk of infection as these treatments target immune-related pathways. Overexpression and activation of integrin alpha-9 (α9) on fibroblast-like synoviocytes are associated with RA disease onset and exacerbation. The humanized immunoglobulin G1 monoclonal antibody ASP5094 was designed to inhibit human α9 and is currently under investigation for the treatment of RA. This phase 2a, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group study (NCT03257852) evaluated the efficacy, safety, and biological activity of intravenous ASP5094 10 mg/kg in patients with moderate to severe RA that was refractory to MTX. Patients received ASP5094 or placebo every 4 weeks for a total of three administrations. Both treatment groups used concomitant MTX. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients who responded per American College of Rheumatology 50% improvement using C-reactive protein (ACR50-CRP) after 12 weeks of treatment. Biological activity of ASP5094 was assessed via pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of known downstream effectors of α9. Safety was also assessed. Sixty-six patients were enrolled and randomized to placebo (n = 33) or ASP5094 (n = 33). In the primary efficacy analysis, ACR50-CRP response rates were 6.3% and 18.2% at week 12 in the ASP5094 and placebo groups, respectively; a difference of - 11.9, which was not significant (2-sided P value = 0.258). No trends in ACR50 response rates were observed in subgroups based on demographics or baseline disease characteristics, and no significant differences between placebo and ASP5094 were identified in secondary efficacy or pharmacodynamic endpoints, despite achievement of target serum concentrations of ASP5094. Most treatment-emergent adverse events were mild to moderate in severity, and ASP5094 was considered safe and well tolerated overall.

The primary safety objective was to demonstrate that the algorithm did not result in pauses or heart rates of >100 beats/min. Overall, 75 patients from 12 centers were enrolled; an accelerometer-based algorithm was downloaded to their leadless pacemakers. Among the 40 patients with sinus rhythm and complete AV block included in the primary efficacy objective analysis, the proportion of patients with ≥70% AV synchrony at rest was significantly greater with VDD pacing than with VVI pacing (95% vs. 0%; p < 0.001).

Using an Experimental Human Challenge Model and influenza vaccines, we examined symptoms experienced by healthy adults during nasal co-infection with S. pneumoniae and live attenuated influenza virus. Randomised, blinded administration of Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV) or Tetravalent Inactivated Influenza Vaccine (TIV) either preceded bacterial inoculation or followed it, separated by a 3-day interval.

This randomized controlled trial further explored the benefits of cHAT for patients with SUDs. Fifty patients in residential SUD treatment at the Department of Addiction Treatment, Oslo University Hospital, were randomly allocated to either cHAT (cHAT group) or treatment as usual alone (TAU-only group).

The multinomial logistic regression analysis found no statistically significant association between intervention (cHAT) and treatment outcome (completion, dropout, transferred) among the 37 participants who were ultimately recruited to the study. Some unforeseen challenges were encountered in the study: a high number of subjects transferred to another treatment, variable attendance at cHAT sessions, and long temporary exits. Nevertheless, 44% of participants in the cHAT group completed their treatment, compared with 32% in the TAU-only group; this observation encourages further investigation in a larger sample. Though no association was identified between cHAT and treatment retention or completion, our study may have been underpowered.

Cognitive function was determined using the Cognitive Performance Scale (CPS). Hospitalization was ascertained by chart review. Participants were 81.7 years of age on average and 65.3% female. At baseline, usual care group participants had better cognitive function than intervention group participants (CPS = 1.33 vs 2.25; P = .004). Delirium symptoms declined over the course of the episode (mean CAM-S = 3.63 at start vs 3.27 at end). Overall, 33.8% of the total sample experienced incident delirium. After adjusting for baseline cognitive function, no significant differences were found in delirium or delirium severity between intervention and usual care groups. Hospitalization was not significantly different between groups. An intervention targeting delirium risk in long-term nursing home residents did not prevent delirium or reduce delirium symptoms. Baseline differences in cognitive function between groups, greater than expected improvements in both groups, quality-enhancing practices such as consistent assignments delivered to both groups, and adaptations of the intervention may have biased results toward null.

MI and cardiovascular death were categorized as: 1) procedural (related to revascularization); 2) definite or probable stent thrombosis (ST); or 3) spontaneous (non-ST or non-procedure-related). Median follow-up was 14.5 months. Among the first events occurring within 30 days, 584 (69.0%) were procedural, 126 (14.9%) ST-related, and 136 (16.1%) spontaneous.

Guidelines recommend targeting systolic blood pressure (SBP) <130 mm Hg in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) with limited data. This study sought to determine the optimal achieved SBP and whether the treatment effects of sacubitril/valsartan on outcomes are related to BP lowering, particularly among women who derive greater benefit from sacubitril/valsartan. Using 4,795 trial participants, this study related baseline and time-updated mean achieved SBP quartiles (<120, 120 to 129, 130 to 139, ≥140 mm Hg) to the primary outcome (cardiovascular death and total heart failure hospitalization), its components, myocardial infarction or stroke, and a renal composite outcome. At the 16-week visit, the study assessed the relationship between SBP change and Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire overall summary score (KCCQ-OSS) and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP). The study analyzed whether the BP-lowering effects of sacubitril/valsartan accounted for its treatment effects. Average age was 73 ± 8 years, and 52% of participants were women. After multivariable adjustment, baseline and mean achieved SBP of 120 to 129 mm Hg demonstrated the lowest risk for all outcomes. Sacubitril/valsartan reduced SBP by 5.2 mm Hg (95% confidence interval: 4.4 to 6.0) compared with valsartan at 4 weeks, which was not modified by baseline SBP. However, sacubitril/valsartan reduced SBP more in women (6.3 mm Hg) than men (4.0 mm Hg) (interaction p = 0.005). Change in SBP was directly associated with change in NT-proBNP (p < 0.001) but not KCCQ-OSS (p = 0.40). The association between sacubitril/valsartan and the primary outcome was not modified by baseline SBP (interaction p = 0.50) and was similar when adjusting for time-updated SBP, regardless of sex.

We aimed to analyze if exercise-training during Christmas holidays would avoid body-weight gains and cardiometabolic deterioration in MetS individuals, using a randomized control trial. Thirty-eight men with MetS undergoing exercise training were randomly allocated to either continue (TRAIN group, n = 16) or discontinue (HOLID group, n = 22) training, during the three weeks of Christmas. Anthropometrics (body weight, fat, and waist circumference), fasting blood metabolites (glucose, insulin, triglycerides, and cholesterol concentrations) and exercise maximal fat oxidation (FOMAX) and oxygen uptake (VO2PEAK) were determined before and after Christmas.

We performed a randomized controlled study to determine the efficacy of panchromoendoscopy in detection of polyps in patients with SPS. Patients with SPS (n = 86 patients) underwent tandem high-definition (HD) colonoscopies from February 2015 through July 2016 at 7 centers in Spain.

For each procedure, polyps detected were described, removed, and analyzed by histology. The primary outcome was additional polyp detection rate, defined as the number of polyps detected during the second inspection divided by the total number of polyps detected during the first and the second examination. A total of 774 polyps were detected (362 in the HD-WLE group and 412 in the HD-CE group); 54.2% were hyperplastic, 13.8% were adenomas, and 10.9% were sessile serrated polyps.

We also tested social constraints (defined as social conditions when individuals feel misunderstood or alienated when they desire to disclose their thoughts and feelings) as a moderator. Chinese American BCSs (n = 136) were randomly assigned to three groups with assigned writing topics for 3 weeks: a self-regulation group, which wrote about the deepest feelings related to cancer in week 1, cognitive reappraisal about stress and coping in week 2, and benefit finding in week 3; an enhanced self-regulation group, with the same instructions, except weeks 1 and 2 were reversed; and a cancer-fact group, which wrote about cancer experiences objectively for 3 weeks. PTSD symptoms were measured at baseline and 1-, 3-, and 6-month follow-ups. Social constraints were measured at baseline. Both the self-regulation and enhanced self-regulation groups showed reduced PTSD symptoms compared to the cancer-fact group. For reexperiencing and hyperarousal symptoms, expressive writing was more effective for BCSs who experienced high vs. low levels of social constraints; the opposite was found for avoidance symptoms.

Many therapies have been shown to improve outcomes for patients with heart failure (HF) in controlled settings, but there are limited data available to inform best practices for hospital and post-discharge quality improvement initiatives. The CONNECT-HF study is a prospective, cluster-randomized trial of 161 hospitals in the United States with a 2×2 factorial design. The study is designed to assess the effect of a hospital and post-discharge quality improvement intervention compared with usual care (primary objective) on HF outcomes and quality-of-care, as well as to evaluate the effect of hospitals implementing a patient-level digital intervention compared with usual care (secondary objective). The hospital and post-discharge intervention includes audit and feedback on HF clinical process measures and outcomes for patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) paired with education to sites and clinicians by a trained, nationally representative group of HF and quality improvement experts. The patient-level digital intervention is an optional ancillary study and includes a mobile application and behavioral tools that are intended to facilitate improved use of guideline-directed recommendations for self-monitoring and self-management of activity and medications for HFrEF. The effects of the interventions will be measured through an opportunity-based composite score on quality and time-to-first HF readmission or death among patients with HFrEF who present to study hospitals with acute HF and who consent to participate.

Hearing rehabilitation after translabyrinthine resection of a vestibular schwannoma (VS) has largely been based on the transfer of acoustic stimulus to the contralateral ear, typically through a contralateral routing of signal hearing aid or bone-anchored hearing aid (BAHA). Cochlear implant, either as a subsequent surgery or simultaneously, has become a more common treatment option; however, there is still relatively limited data available on its success. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the early outcomes of simultaneous cochlear implantation in patients with sporadic VS undergoing translabyrinthine resection. Prospective, nonrandomized study. A prospective study of nonrandomized patients was completed at a tertiary care neurotology center. Audiologic outcomes, primarily based on AzBIO in quiet and background noise, as well as consonant-nucleus-consonant (CNC) testing of the affected ears were utilized. Tinnitus, dizziness, and spatial hearing questionnaries were also completed. Audiologic outcomes and questionnaires were compared between the pre- and postoperative groups. Ten patients were included in the study with 3 month follow-up data. There was statistically significant improvement in AzBO with +10 and +5 signal to noise ratio and in quiet, as well as in CNC testing (P < .05). There was a significant improvement in Tinnitus Handicap Inventory between the two groups. Simultaneous cochlear implantation is a viable treatment for hearing loss after translabyrinthine approach to VS. These patients have improved hearing in background noise and tinnitus compared to their preoperative state.

This study investigates the efficacy of ointments, containing as main active ingredient the olive oil extract of the marine isopod Ceratothoa oestroides, in the treatment of patients with diabetic foot ulcers. Fifty-two patients were allocated into four treatment groups either receiving therapy with an ointment containing extract of C. oestroides or extract of C. oestroides and eosin or extract of C. oestroides and cefaclor or no treatment. Patients were monitored for a period of 135 days by evaluation of transepidermal water loss, skin hydration, planimetry, photo-documentation, and clinical condition. Treatment with the extract of C. oestroides demonstrated significant healing properties that became evident after 45 days of treatment and resulted in complete ulcer healing in 61% of the patients. A significant improvement in transepidermal water loss (p < 0.001), skin hydration levels (p < 0.001), and wound area (p < 0.001) was observed in all patients. Similar efficacy was demonstrated for the combination of C. oestroides extract with eosin treatment (p < 0.001). On the contrary, the combination of C. oestroides extract with cefaclor antibiotic agent completely inhibited the healing properties of the isopod extract and did not improve water loss, skin hydration, or wound area.

Pain is one of the most prevalent symptoms after day surgery. However, pain management is left to the patients and family, and interventions to help patients are needed. Randomised clinical trial with an intervention (n = 101) and a usual care group (n = 119) using multiple measurements during 6 months postoperatively. The CONSORT checklist is used. Patients in the intervention group received a booklet about pain and pain management and coaching by research nurses on postoperative days 2, 3 and 7. Differences between groups were identified using the chi-squared analysis and t tests. Changes with time were identified using a linear mixed model with repeated measures. After controlling for covariates, group differences at any time in average pain intensity and pain interference with function were not statistically significant. Changes over time within any one group in average pain intensity and pain interference with function were statistically significant and decreased with time. Higher levels of average pain intensity and pain interference over time were associated with shoulder surgery, female, younger, pain expectation, preoperative pain and poorer adherence.

This cohort-embedded, investigator-initiated, multicenter, open-label, bayesian randomized clinical trial investigating patients with COVID-19 and moderate or severe pneumonia requiring at least 3 L/min of oxygen but without ventilation or admission to the intensive care unit was conducted between March 31, 2020, to April 18, 2020, with follow-up through 28 days. Patients were recruited from 9 university hospitals in France. Analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis with no correction for multiplicity for secondary outcomes. Patients were randomly assigned to receive TCZ, 8 mg/kg, intravenously plus usual care on day 1 and on day 3 if clinically indicated (TCZ group) or to receive usual care alone (UC group). Usual care included antibiotic agents, antiviral agents, corticosteroids, vasopressor support, and anticoagulants. Primary outcomes were scores higher than 5 on the World Health Organization 10-point Clinical Progression Scale (WHO-CPS) on day 4 and survival without need of ventilation (including noninvasive ventilation) at day 14. Secondary outcomes were clinical status assessed with the WHO-CPS scores at day 7 and day 14, overall survival, time to discharge, time to oxygen supply independency, biological factors such as C-reactive protein level, and adverse events. Of 131 patients, 64 patients were randomly assigned to the TCZ group and 67 to UC group; 1 patient in the TCZ group withdrew consent and was not included in the analysis. Of the 130 patients, 42 were women (32%), and median (interquartile range) age was 64 (57.1-74.3) years.

All subjects completed the study. At each puncture site, 1 g EMLA (25 mg lidocaine + 25 mg prilocaine) or one sheet of lidocaine tape (18 mg lidocaine) was applied 1 h or 30 min prior to arteriovenous fistula puncture, respectively. The primary endpoint was puncture pain relief, which was measured using a 100-mm visual analog scale. The secondary endpoints included quality of life, which was measured by SF-36, and safety.

Galcanezumab is a monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and is indicated for the preventive treatment of migraine. Galcanezumab demonstrated early onset of effect in patients with migraine but it is unknown whether the same holds true for patients who have not benefited from multiple prior migraine preventives. Patients with episodic or chronic migraine from a 3-month, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3b study (CONQUER) who had 2 to 4 migraine preventive medication category failures in the past 10 years were randomized 1:1 to placebo (N = 230) or galcanezumab 120 mg/month (240 mg loading dose; N = 232). In this post-hoc analysis, change from baseline in number of monthly and weekly migraine headache days was assessed. Monthly onset of effect was the earliest month at which significant improvement with galcanezumab compared to placebo was achieved and maintained at all subsequent months. Weekly onset was the initial week at which statistical separation was achieved and maintained at all subsequent weeks during that month.

This study aimed at assessing the morphometry of resected femurs in Korean patients during total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and comparing these measurements with current Western-designed femoral component dimensions. This single-blind, prospective, randomized, controlled trial involved intraoperative measurements for 271 femoral component implantations from 3 contemporary TKA systems, with 2 systems offering narrow sizing options. The difference between femoral component dimensions and the resected surface of distal femur was measured in millimeters at 5 distinct zones. Overhang of standard femoral component was common in the anterior-medial condyle and anterior-lateral condyle ranging from 50.8% to 99.0% and 21.5% to 88.0%, respectively. With narrow femoral components, the rate of overhang reduced to 21.5%-30.2% and 9.2%-32.1%. Conversely, underhang rates were higher over the anterior flange width, middle medial-lateral and posterior medial-lateral zones. Standard components displayed higher underhang rates at these zones compared to narrow components. The good fit rate for femoral component was low among the 3 systems ranging from 1.0% to 56.0%. System with narrow option sizing increases the underhang rates in males, while improving the component fit among females at similar zones with rate ranging from 5.2% to 52.9%.

Aim Accumulated evidence suggests that vitamin A and D agonists can alleviate the development of atherosclerosis. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the effect of vitamin A and D combination supplement on interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and clinical outcome in ischemic stroke. Methods A single-blind, randomized controlled trial was conducted on ischemic stroke patients at Adam Malik Hospital between March 2018 to February 2019. The patients were randomized into 4 groups of the treatment consisting of supplementation using vitamin A or D only, combination of vitamin A and D, and placebo group, all given for 12 weeks. Clinical outcome was determined using the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS). At the time of admission and after the treatment was completed, all patients were measured for vitamin A, vitamin D, and IL-1β serum level, and NIHSS score. Results From the total of 120 patients, in the combination group there were significant increments on both vitamin A (p=0.04) and vitamin D (p=0.01) serum level after 12 weeks of the treatment, compared to the other groups. In conjunction, IL-1β serum level showed a significant decrement in the combination group (p<0.001). Lastly, the biggest improvement of NIHSS could be seen in the combination group, which was marked by the highest decrement of NIHSS score (p<0.001).

In a phase 2b dose-finding trial, we randomly assigned patients to receive ligelizumab at a dose of 24 mg, 72 mg, or 240 mg, omalizumab at a dose of 300 mg, or placebo, administered subcutaneously every 4 weeks for a period of 20 weeks, or a single 120-mg dose of ligelizumab. Disease symptoms of hives, itch, and angioedema were monitored by means of weekly activity scores. The main objective was to determine a dose-response relationship for the complete control of hives (indicated by a weekly hives-severity score of 0, on a scale from 0 to 21, with higher scores indicating greater severity); the primary end point of this response was assessed at week 12. Complete symptom control was indicated by a weekly urticaria activity score of 0 (on a scale from 0 to 42, with higher scores indicating greater severity). Safety was analyzed throughout the trial. A total of 382 patients underwent randomization. At week 12, a total of 30%, 51%, and 42% of the patients treated with 24 mg, 72 mg, and 240 mg, respectively, of ligelizumab had complete control of hives, as compared with 26% of the patients in the omalizumab group and no patients in the placebo group.

Apatinib may be an effective and safe second- or further-line treatment for advanced esophageal cancer. Apatinib is an inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR2), which is thought to play a role in esophageal cancer progression. Our goal was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of apatinib in patients with unresectable esophageal cancer and to examine whether VEGFR2 expression influenced the clinical response. This single-arm, open-label, investigator-initiated phase II study enrolled patients with advanced squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) or adenocarcinoma of the esophagus or esophagogastric junction who were admitted to Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital between August 2017 and January 2019. Apatinib monotherapy (500 mg/day) was given orally or via an enteral tube until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal, or death. Patients were followed until treatment was discontinued or death. The main endpoints were tumor response, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and adverse events (AEs).

The objective was to test whether apoCIII is regulated postprandially and whether apoCIII concentrations in native and chylomicron-free serum predict future cardiovascular events in patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD). ApoCIII concentrations were measured in native and chylomicron-free serum in the fasting state and after a standardized oral fat load test in 195 patients with stable CAD. Clinical follow-up was 48 months. Chylomicron-free serum was prepared by ultracentrifugation (18,000 rpm, 3 h). The log-rank test and Cox regression analyses were used to investigate the association of apoCIII with recurrent cardiovascular events. Of the 195 patients included, 92 had a cardiovascular event, and 103 did not. 97% were treated with a statin. No significant changes in apoCIII concentration were observed after the oral fat load test. The apoCIII concentration was associated with event-free survival independent of conventional risk factors. This association reached statistical significance only for apoCIII concentration measured in chylomicron-free serum (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval] for apoCIII above the mean: postprandial: 1.67 (1.06-2.29), P = 0.028, fasting: 2.09 (1.32-3.32), P = 0.002), but not for apoCIII concentration measured in native serum (postprandial: 1.47 [0.89-2.43], P = 0.133, fasting: 1.56 [0.95-2.58], P = 0.081). The effects were independent of other risk factors. ApoCIII concentrations in chylomicron-free serum are independently associated with event-free survival in patients with CAD both in fasting and postprandial state.

Second, co-occurring psychological problems are often neglected or not diagnosed, although post-stroke depression is common and related to cognitive deficits. This pilot trial aims to test a rehabilitation program in virtual reality that trains various cognitive domains in conjunction, by adapting to the patient's disability and while investigating the influence of comorbidities.

Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) represents the cornerstone in atrial fibrillation ablation. Cryoballoon and laserballoon catheters have emerged as promising devices but lack randomized comparisons. Therefore, we sought to compare efficacy and safety comparing both balloons in patients with persistent and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF). Symptomatic AF patients (n=200) were prospectively randomized (1:1) to receive either cryoballoon or laserballoon PVI (cryoballoon: n=100: 50 paroxysmal atrial fibrillation + 50 persistent AF versus laserballoon: n=100: 50 paroxysmal atrial fibrillation + 50 persistent AF). All antiarrhythmic drugs were stopped after ablation. Follow-up included 3-day Holter-ECG recordings and office visits at 3, 6, and 12 months. Primary efficacy end point was defined as freedom from atrial tachyarrhythmia between 90 and 365 days after a single ablation. Secondary end points included procedural parameters and periprocedural complications. Patient baseline parameters were not different between both groups. In all (n=200) complete PVI was obtained and the entire follow-up accomplished. Balloon only PVI was obtained in 98% (cryoballoon) versus 95% (laserballoon) requiring focal touch-up in 2 and 5 patients, respectively.

Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7), a neurodegenerative disease characterized by cerebellar ataxia and retinal degeneration, is caused by an abnormal CAG repeat expansion in the ATXN7 gene coding region. The onset and severity of SCA7 are highly variable between patients, thus identification of sensitive biomarkers that accurately diagnose the disease and monitoring its progression are needed. With the aim of identified SCA7-specific metabolites with clinical relevance, we report for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, a metabolomics profiling of circulating acylcarnitines and amino acids in SCA7 patients. We identified 21 metabolites with altered levels in SCA7 patients and determined two different sets of metabolites with diagnostic power. The first signature of metabolites (Valine, Leucine, and Tyrosine) has the ability to discriminate between SCA7 patients and healthy controls, while the second one (Methionine, 3-hydroxytetradecanoyl-carnitine, and 3-hydroxyoctadecanoyl-carnitine) possess the capability to differentiate between early-onset and adult-onset patients, as shown by the multivariate model and ROC analyses. Furthermore, enrichment analyses of metabolic pathways suggest alterations in mitochondrial function, energy metabolism, and fatty acid beta-oxidation in SCA7 patients.

A prospective, randomised, triple blind, controlled, parallel group trial with patients randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio between January and December 2015, with a two month follow up, from a single academic medical centre in Brazil, was carried out. Participants were women aged 18-65 years with telangiectasias on the lateral aspect of one thigh, classified as C1EpAsPn who underwent sclerotherapy in a single session with 0.2% polidocanol + 70% HG or 75% HG alone to treat the telangiectasias on an area limited by a rectangular template. The primary effectiveness endpoint was elimination of 75% of the telangiectasias within 60 days vs. the pre-treatment pattern. The length of vessels was measured on images obtained before and after treatment using ImageJ software.

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), due to their potential for differentiation into alveolar epithelial cells and their immunosuppressive characteristics, are considered a new therapeutic agent in cell-based therapy of inflammatory lung disorders, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Since most of the MSC-mediated beneficent effects were the consequence of their paracrine action, herewith, we investigated the effects of a newly designed MSC-derived product Exosome-derived Multiple Allogeneic Protein Paracrine Signaling (Exo-d-MAPPS) in the attenuation of chronic airway inflammation by using an animal model of COPD (induced by chronic exposure to cigarette smoke (CS)) and clinical data obtained from Exo-d-MAPPS-treated COPD patients. Exo-d-MAPPS contains a high concentration of immunomodulatory factors which are capable of attenuating chronic airway inflammation, including soluble TNF receptors I and II, IL-1 receptor antagonist, and soluble receptor for advanced glycation end products. Accordingly, Exo-d-MAPPS significantly improved respiratory function, downregulated serum levels of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-12, and IFN-γ), increased serum concentration of immunosuppressive IL-10, and attenuated chronic airway inflammation in CS-exposed mice. The cellular makeup of the lungs revealed that Exo-d-MAPPS treatment attenuated the production of inflammatory cytokines in lung-infiltrated macrophages, neutrophils, and natural killer and natural killer T cells and alleviated the antigen-presenting properties of lung-infiltrated macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs). Additionally, Exo-d-MAPPS promoted the expansion of immunosuppressive IL-10-producing alternatively activated macrophages, regulatory DCs, and CD4+FoxP3+T regulatory cells in inflamed lungs which resulted in the attenuation of chronic airway inflammation. In a similar manner, as it was observed in an animal model, Exo-d-MAPPS treatment significantly improved the pulmonary status and quality of life of COPD patients. Importantly, Exo-d-MAPPS was well tolerated since none of the 30 COPD patients reported any adverse effects after Exo-d-MAPPS administration. In summing up, we believe that Exo-d-MAPPS could be considered a potentially new therapeutic agent in the treatment of chronic inflammatory lung diseases whose efficacy should be further explored in large clinical trials.", "label": [[609, 721, "I"], [744, 924, "P"], [72, 121, "I"], [140, 167, "P"], [2346, 2566, "B"]]}

Background and objectives: The fixed-rate continuous background infusion mode with bolus dosing is a common modality for intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (PCA). However, some patients suffer from inadequate analgesia or opioid-related adverse effects due to the biphasic pattern of postoperative pain. Therefore, we investigated the postoperative analgesic efficacy of PCA using an optimizing background infusion mode (OBIM) where the background injection rate varies depending on the patient's bolus demand. Materials and Methods: We prospectively enrolled 204 patients who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy in a randomized, controlled, double-blind study. Patients were allocated to either the optimizing (group OBIM) or the traditional background infusion group (group TBIM). The numeric rating scale (NRS) score for pain was evaluated at admission to and discharge from the recovery room, as well as at the 6th, 24th, and 48th postoperative hours. Data on bolus demand count, total infused volume, and background infusion rate were downloaded from the PCA device at 30-min intervals until the 48th postoperative hour. Results: The NRS score was not significantly different between groups throughout the postoperative period (p = 0.621), decreasing with time in both groups (p < 0.001). The bolus demand count was not significantly different between groups throughout (p = 0.756).

The total cumulative opioid dose in fentanyl equivalents, after converting sufentanil to fentanyl using an equipotential dose ratio, was lower in group OBIM (714.1 (647.4-780.9) μg) than in group TBIM (963.7 (870.5-1056.9) μg); p < 0.001). The background infusion rate was significantly different between groups throughout the study period (p < 0.001); it was higher in group OBIM than in group TBIM before the 12th postoperative hour and lower from the 18th to the 48th postoperative hour. Conclusions: The OBIM combined with bolus dosing reduces the cumulative PCA volume and opioid consumption compared to the TBIM combined with bolus dosing, while yielding comparable postoperative analgesia and bolus demand in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy.", "label": [[167, 215, "P"], [617, 649, "X"], [653, 791, "I"], [842, 897, "P"], [985, 1008, "I"], [1068, 1409, "X"], [1016, 1066, "C"], [2333, 2607, "B"]]}

The long-term effects of behavioural medical rehabilitation (BMR), as a type of multidisciplinary rehabilitation, in the treatment of chronic non-specific low back pain (CLBP) have been shown. However, the specific effects of behavioural exercise therapy (BET) compared to standard exercise therapy (SET) within BMR are not well understood. The aim of the study was to assess the effectiveness of BMR + BET compared to BMR + SET in individuals with CLBP in a two-armed, pre-registered, multicentre, parallel, randomised controlled trial (RCT). A total of 351 adults with CLBP in two rehabilitation centres were online randomised based on an 'urn randomisation' algorithm to either BMR + SET (n = 175) or BMR + BET (n = 176). Participants in both study groups were non-blinded and received BMR, consisting of an multidisciplinary admission, a psychosocial assessment, multidisciplinary case management, psychological treatment, health education and social counselling. The intervention group (BMR + BET) received a manualised, biopsychosocial BET within BMR. The aim of BET was to develop self-management strategies in coping with CLBP. The control group (BMR + SET) received biomedical SET within BMR with the aim to improve mainly physical fitness. Therapists in both study groups were not blinded. The BMR lasted on average 27 days, and both exercise programmes had a mean duration of 26 h. The primary outcome was functional ability at 12 months. Secondary outcomes were e.g. pain, avoidance-endurance, pain management and physical activity. The analysis was by intention-to-treat, blinded to the study group, and used a linear mixed model. There were no between-group differences observed in function at the end of the BMR (mean difference, 0.08; 95% CI - 2.82 to 2.99; p = 0.955), at 6 months (mean difference, - 1.80; 95% CI; - 5.57 to 1.97; p = 0.349) and at 12 months (mean difference, - 1.33; 95% CI - 5.57 to 2.92; p = 0.540).

In this analysis we investigated the association between epiaortic ultrasound-based atheroma grade during surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) and perioperative adverse outcomes. SAVR patients in a randomized trial of 2 embolic protection devices underwent a protocol-defined 5-view epiaortic ultrasound read at a core laboratory. Aortic atherosclerosis was quantified with the Katz atheroma grade, and patients were categorized as mild (grade I-II) or moderate/severe (grade III-V). Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate associations between atheroma grade and adverse outcomes, including death, clinically apparent stroke, cerebral infarction on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, delirium, and acute kidney injury (AKI) by 7 and 30 days. Precannulation epiaortic ultrasound data were available for 326 of 383 randomized patients (85.1%). Of these, 106 (32.5%) had moderate/severe Katz atheroma grade at any segment of the ascending aorta. Although differences in the composite of death, stroke, or cerebral infarction on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging by 7 days were not statistically significant, moderate/severe atheroma grade was associated with a greater risk of AKI by 7 days (adjusted odds ratio, 2.63; 95% confidence interval, 1.24-5.58; P = .01). At 30 days, patients with moderate/severe atheroma grade had a greater risk of death, stroke, or AKI (adjusted odds ratio, 1.97; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-3.71; P = .04).

Collateral status modified the effect of endovascular treatment (EVT) for stroke in several randomized trials. We assessed the association between collaterals and functional outcome in EVT treated patients and investigated if this association is time dependent. We included consecutive patients from the Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke in The Netherlands (MR CLEAN) Registry (March 2014-June 2016) with an anterior circulation large vessel occlusion undergoing EVT. Functional outcome was measured on the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at 90 days. We investigated the association between collaterals and mRS in the MR CLEAN Registry with ordinal logistic regression and if this association was time dependent with an interaction term. Additionally, we determined modification of EVT effect by collaterals compared with MR CLEAN controls, and also investigated if this was time dependent with multiplicative interaction terms. 1412 patients were analyzed. Functional independence (mRS score of 0-2) was achieved in 13% of patients with grade 0 collaterals, in 27% with grade 1, in 46% with grade 2, and in 53% with grade 3. Collaterals were significantly associated with mRS (adjusted common OR 1.5 (95% CI 1.4 to 1.7)) and significantly modified EVT benefit (P=0.04). None of the effects were time dependent. Better collaterals corresponded to lower mortality (P<0.001), but not to lower rates of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (P=0.14).

Patients undergoing potentially curative resection of the rectum were included. They were randomized to intraoperative radiotherapy of the completely preserved bilateral pelvic nerve plexuses (IORT group) or the control group without IORT, but with limited nerve preservation. The primary endpoint was pelvic sidewall recurrence. Moreover, patients' clinicopathologic parameters, postoperative complications, voiding function, and other oncologic outcomes were compared.

The role of tumour-infiltrating inflammatory cells (TIICs) in the disease progression of hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer (HR+ BC) is largely unclear since it is generally regarded as the least immunogenic BC subtype. This study investigated the prognostic significance of CD1a+ dendritic cells, CD20+ B cells, CD45RO+ memory T cells and CD4+ T-helper cells in HR+ BC. One hundred and forty-six patients were treated for early stage, distant-metastases-free HR+ BC in an accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) phase II trial. Immunohistochemistry was used to double-stain two adjoining sets of tissue microarrays from pre-RT (radiotherapy) tumour resection samples for CD1a/CD20 and CD45RO/CD4. Cell densities of CD1a+, CD20+, CD45RO+ and CD4+ TIICs in the stromal and intraepithelial compartment were registered semiautomatically. High densities of CD20+ and CD4+ TIICs were strongly associated with reduced disease-free survival (DFS), while high stromal CD45RO+ TIIC densities were indicators of subsequent successful treatment. An immunoscore based on CD20+ and CD45RO+ TIIC densities identified three different risk groups (p < 0.001).

To assess whether vision-threatening retinopathy developed after 4 years in patients with type 2 diabetes with good glycemic control during follow-up. Using data from the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes and Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes Follow-on studies (conducted from January 1, 2001, to October 14, 2014), we investigated the incidence of vision-threatening retinopathy after 4 years in patients with type 2 diabetes with good or poor glycemic control. Patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy at baseline were excluded. Vision-threatening retinopathy was defined as severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy, proliferative diabetic retinopathy, laser photocoagulation, or vitrectomy. Good and poor glycemic control was defined as mean glycated hemoglobin level less than 7% and 7% or greater during follow-up, respectively. This study included 2285 patients. Among patients with no retinopathy at baseline, the 4-year incidence of vision-threatening retinopathy was 0% (0 of 386) and 0.8% (6 of 721) in those with good and poor glycemic control, respectively (P=.54). Similarly, severe retinopathy was not observed at 8 years in patients who did not have retinopathy at 4 years.

Cell salvage has recently been recommended for obstetric use in cases with a high risk of massive hemorrhage during cesarean section (CS). However, limited data are available to support the use of one suction device to collect lost blood. This study aimed to investigate the volume of red blood cells (RBCs) salvaged and the components of amniotic fluid (AF) in blood salvaged by one suction device or two devices during CS in patients with placenta previa and/or accrete. Thirty patients with placenta previa and/or accrete undergoing elective CS in the Women's Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine were recruited for the present study from November 1, 2017 to December 1, 2018. The patients were randomly assigned to one of the two groups according to an Excel-generated random number sheet: Group 1 (n = 15), in which only one suction device was used to aspirate all blood and AF, and Group 2 (n = 15), in which a second suction device was mainly used to aspirate AF before the delivery of the placenta. Three samples of blood per patient (pre-wash, post-wash, and post-filtration) were collected to measure AF components. The salvaged RBC volumes were recorded. Continuous data of pre-wash, post-wash, and post-filtration samples were analyzed by using one-way analysis of variance with Tukey's test for multiple comparisons, or Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn test for multiple comparisons. Comparisons of continuous data between Group 1 and Group 2 were conducted using Student's t test or Mann-Whitney U test. The salvaged RBC volume was significantly higher in Group 1 than that in Group 2 (401.6 ± 77.2 mL vs. 330.1 ± 53.3 mL, t = 4.175, P < 0.001). In both groups, squamous cells, lamellar bodies, and fat were significantly reduced by washing (all P<0.001) and squamous cells were further reduced by filtering (P < 0.001). Squamous cells were found in six post-filtration samples (three from each group). Lamellar bodies and fat were completely removed by filtering. Insulin-like growth factor binding protein 1, alpha-fetoprotein, albumin, lactate dehydrogenase, and potassium were significantly reduced post-wash (all P < 0.05), with no further significant reduction after filtration in either group (all P > 0.05).

Small fibre neuropathy is a common pain disorder, which in many cases fails to respond to treatment with existing medications. Gain-of-function mutations of voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.7 underlie dorsal root ganglion neuronal hyperexcitability and pain in a subset of patients with small fibre neuropathy. Recent clinical studies have demonstrated that lacosamide, which blocks sodium channels in a use-dependent manner, attenuates pain in some patients with Nav1.7 mutations; however, only a subgroup of these patients responded to the drug. Here, we used voltage-clamp recordings to evaluate the effects of lacosamide on five Nav1.7 variants from patients who were responsive or non-responsive to treatment. We show that, at the clinically achievable concentration of 30 μM, lacosamide acts as a potent sodium channel inhibitor of Nav1.7 variants carried by responsive patients, via a hyperpolarizing shift of voltage-dependence of both fast and slow inactivation and enhancement of use-dependent inhibition. By contrast, the effects of lacosamide on slow inactivation and use-dependence in Nav1.7 variants from non-responsive patients were less robust. Importantly, we found that lacosamide selectively enhances fast inactivation only in variants from responders. Taken together, these findings begin to unravel biophysical underpinnings that contribute to responsiveness to lacosamide in patients with small fibre neuropathy carrying select Nav1.7 variants.", "label": [[23, 33, "I"], [741, 751, "I"], [755, 840, "P"], [37, 124, "P"], [1399, 1593, "B"], [0, 19, "X"]]}

Patients aged 18 years or older with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, HER2-positive, operable, locally advanced, or inflammatory stage II-IIIC breast cancer, and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 55% or more were randomly assigned (1:1), using a voice-based or web-based response system, to receive intravenous pertuzumab (840 mg loading dose, followed by 420 mg maintenance doses) plus intravenous trastuzumab (8 mg/kg loading dose, followed by 6 mg/kg maintenance doses) or the fixed-dose combination of pertuzumab and trastuzumab for subcutaneous injection (1200 mg pertuzumab plus 600 mg trastuzumab loading dose in 15 mL, followed by 600 mg pertuzumab plus 600 mg trastuzumab maintenance doses in 10 mL), both administered every 3 weeks with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Patients were stratified by hormone receptor status, clinical stage, and chemotherapy regimen. The investigator selected one of the two protocol-approved standard chemotherapy regimens before randomisation. Four cycles of HER2-targeted therapy were administered concurrently with the taxane. After surgery, patients continued the HER2-targeted therapy to receive an additional 14 cycles (total of 18). The primary endpoint was non-inferiority of the cycle 7 pertuzumab serum trough concentration (Ctrough; ie, cycle 8 predose pertuzumab concentration) within the fixed-dose combination for subcutaneous injection versus intravenous pertuzumab plus trastuzumab in the per-protocol pharmacokinetic population (all enrolled patients who adhered to prespecified criteria for pharmacokinetic assessment). Non-inferiority was concluded if the lower bound of the 90% CI of the geometric mean ratio was 0·8 or higher. The safety population included all patients who received at least one dose of study medication, including chemotherapy or HER2-targeted therapy. Enrolment, neoadjuvant therapy, and surgery have been completed; adjuvant treatment and follow-up are ongoing. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03493854. Between June 14, 2018, and Dec 24, 2018, 252 patients were randomly assigned to the intravenous infusion group and 248 to the fixed-dose combination group. The geometric mean ratio of pertuzumab serum Ctrough subcutaneous to serum Ctrough intravenous was 1·22 (90% CI 1·14-1·31). The most common grade 3-4 adverse events occurring during neoadjuvant treatment with HER2-targeted therapy plus chemotherapy in 5% or more of patients were neutropenia (34 [13%] of 252 patients in the intravenous infusion group vs 35 [14%] of 248 patients in the fixed-dose combination group), decreased neutrophil count (31 [12%] vs 27 [11%]), febrile neutropenia (14 [6%] vs 16 [6%]), diarrhoea (12 [5%] vs 17 [7%]), and decreased white blood cell count (18 [7%] vs nine [4%]). At least one treatment-related serious adverse event was reported in 25 (10%) patients in the intravenous infusion group and 26 (10%) patients in the fixed-dose combination group. One patient in each treatment group had an adverse event that led to death (urosepsis in the intravenous infusion group and acute myocardial infarction in the fixed-dose combination group); neither death was related to HER2-targeted therapy. The study met its primary endpoint: the fixed-dose combination of pertuzumab and trastuzumab for subcutaneous injection provides non-inferior cycle 7 pertuzumab serum Ctrough concentrations to intravenous pertuzumab plus trastuzumab in the neoadjuvant setting with comparable total pathological complete response rates, supporting the FDA approval.

Neurologic events included ischemic stroke (ischemic cerebrovascular accident [ICVA]), hemorrhagic stroke (hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident [HCVA]), and transient ischemic attack (TIA). Peri-operative strokes were defined as occurring within 2 weeks of the implant. A total of 604 patients received an HVAD in the DT (n = 296) and DT2 (n = 308) trials. Over 2 years, 178 (29.5%) had at least 1 cerebrovascular accident (CVA). Forty-four (7.3%) had HCVAs, 116 (19.2%) had ICVAs, and 44 (7.3%) had TIAs. Thirty (5.0%) had peri-operative stroke. In multivariable analysis, sub-therapeutic international normalized ratio (INR) values were independently associated with peri-operative stroke. Supra- and/or sub-therapeutic INR values, peripheral vascular disease, and presence of left ventricular thrombus were independently associated with ICVA.

In this retrospective study, we investigated the potential value of CT texture features to diagnose LN metastasis using preoperative CT data and patient characteristics by developing quantitative prediction models. A total of 390 CC patients, undergone surgical resection, were enrolled in this monocentric study. 390 histologically validated LNs were collected from patients and randomly separated into training (312 patients, 155 metastatic and 157 normal LNs) and test cohorts (78 patients, 39 metastatic and 39 normal LNs). Six patient characteristics and 146 quantitative CT imaging features were analyzed and key variables were determined using either exhaustive search or least absolute shrinkage algorithm. Two kernel-based support vector machine classifiers (patient-characteristic model and radiomic-derived model), generated with 10-fold cross-validation, were compared with the clinical model that utilizes long-axis diameter for diagnosis of metastatic LN. The performance of the models was evaluated on the test cohort by computing accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating curve (AUC). The clinical model had an overall diagnostic accuracy of 64.87%; specifically, accuracy of 65.38% and 62.82%, sensitivity of 83.87% and 84.62%, and specificity of 47.13% and 41.03% for training and test cohorts, respectively.

For normally sighted readers, word neighborhood size (i.e., the total number of words that can be formed from a single word by changing only one letter) has a facilitator effect on word recognition. When reading with central field loss (CFL) however, individual letters may not be correctly identified, leading to possible misidentifications and a reverse neighborhood size effect. Here we investigate this inhibitory effect of word neighborhood size on reading performance and whether it is modulated by word predictability and reading proficiency. Nineteen patients with binocular CFL from 32 to 89 years old (mean ± SD = 75 ± 15) read short sentences presented with the self-paced reading paradigm. Accuracy and reading time were measured for each target word read, along with its predictability, i.e., its probability of occurrence following the two preceding words in the sentence using a trigram analysis. Linear mixed effects models were then fit to estimate the individual contributions of word neighborhood size, predictability, frequency and length on accuracy and reading time, while taking patients' reading proficiency into account. For the less proficient readers, who have given up daily reading as a consequence of their visual impairment, we found that the effect of neighborhood size was reversed compared to normally sighted readers and of higher amplitude than the effect of frequency. Furthermore, this inhibitory effect is of greater amplitude (up to 50% decrease in reading speed) when a word is not easily predictable because its chances to occur after the two preceding words in a specific sentence are rather low. Severely impaired patients with CFL often quit reading on a daily basis because this task becomes simply too exhausting.

Self-management of hypertension is of great significance given its increasing incidence and its associated disabilities. In view of the increased use of mobile health in medicine, the present study evaluated the effect of a self-management application on patient adherence to hypertension treatment. This clinical trial was performed on 120 hypertensive patients who were provided with a mobile intervention for 8 weeks and followed up until the 24th week. Data on the primary outcome (adherence to treatment) and secondary outcomes (adherence to the DASH diet, regular monitoring of blood pressure, and physical activity) were collected using a questionnaire and a mobile application, respectively. The inter-group change difference over time was analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA (general linear model). The treatment adherence score increased by an average of 5.9 (95% CI 5.0-6.7) in the intervention group compared to the control group. The scores of adherence to the low-fat and low-salt diet plans were 1.7 (95% CI 1.3-2.1) and 1.5 (95% CI 1.2-1.9), respectively. Moreover, moderate physical activity increased to 100.0 min (95% CI 61.7-138.3) per week in the intervention group.

Objective: It is unclear whether the institution of gluten-free diet (GFD) is beneficial in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) and subclinical celiac disease (CD). Our primary objective was to evaluate the effect of GFD on the frequency of hypoglycemia, in patients with T1DM and subclinical CD. Our secondary objective was to investigate the effect of GFD on height, weight, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), insulin dose requirement, and bone mineral homeostasis. Methods: We carried out a prospective open label randomized controlled trial (RCT). Patients with T1DM and subclinical CD were randomized to receive GFD or a normal diet for 1 year. The primary outcome was the frequency of hypoglycemic episodes (blood glucose <70 mg/dL) measured by self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) at the sixth month of the study in the 2 groups. Results: Screening for CD was carried out in 320 T1DM patients. Thirty eligible patients were randomized to receive GFD (n = 15) or a normal diet (n = 15). The mean number of hypoglycemic episodes/month recorded by SMBG and the mean time spent in hypoglycemia measured by CGM (minutes) in the GFD group versus the non-GFD group at six months was 2.3 minutes versus 3.4 minutes (P = .5) and 124.1 minutes versus 356.9 minutes (P = .1), respectively. The mean number of hypoglycemic episodes/month significantly declined in the GFD group (3.5 episodes at baseline versus 2.3 episodes at the sixth month; P = .03). The mean HbA1c declined by 0.73% in the GFD group and rose by 0.99% in non-GFD group at study completion. Conclusion: This is the first RCT to assess the effect of GFD in T1DM and subclinical CD. A trend towards a decrease in hypoglycemic episodes and better glycemic control was seen in patients receiving GFD.

To examine whether low baseline diastolic blood pressure (DBP) modifies the effects of intensive systolic blood pressure (SBP) lowering on cardiovascular outcomes in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes Blood Pressure trial (ACCORD BP), a two-by-two factorial randomized controlled trial, examined effects of SBP (<120 vs. <140 mmHg) and glycemic (HbA1c <6% vs. 7.0-7.9% [<42 vs. 53-63 mmol/mol]) control on cardiovascular events in T2DM (N = 4,731). We examined whether effects of SBP control on cardiovascular composite were modified by baseline DBP and glycemic control. Intensive SBP lowering decreased the risk of the cardiovascular composite (hazard ratio [HR] 0.76 [95% CI 0.59-0.98]) in the standard glycemic arm but not in the intensive glycemic arm (HR 1.06 [95% CI 0.81-1.40]). Spline regression models relating the effects of the intervention on the cardiovascular composite across the range of baseline DBP did not show evidence of effect modification by low baseline DBP for the cardiovascular composite in the standard or intensive glycemic arms. The relation between the effect of the intensive SBP intervention and baseline DBP was similar between glycemic arms for the cardiovascular composite three-way interaction (P = 0.83). In persons with T2DM, intensive SBP lowering decreased the risk of cardiovascular composite end point irrespective of baseline DBP in the setting of standard glycemic control.

During general anaesthesia, most patients develop atelectasis, which promotes postoperative pulmonary complications. RCTs that investigated perioperative lung protection have failed to reduce postoperative pulmonary complications consistently. Ultrasound imaging could help confirm the effects of different protective ventilatory strategies, but this has not been tested in trials. The objective of this study was to use ultrasonography to evaluate whether lung-protective ventilation measures reduce perioperative atelectasis. We conducted a prospective, randomised patient- and assessor-blinded controlled trial in women undergoing open gynaecological surgery. Subjects were randomised to either lung protection or zero end-expiratory pressure (ZEEP; with no recruitment manoeuvres [RMs]). Lung protection entailed PEEP (7 cm H2O) and RMs every 30 min. Lung ultrasonography was undertaken at five predefined time points. The primary outcome was the difference in lung ultrasonography score (LUS) between groups before emergence; a lower LUS indicates better lung aeration. We recruited 45 women (34-85 yr old). Women randomised to lung protection had lower mean (standard deviation) LUS before emergence (6.1 [3.7]), compared with women randomised to ZEEP (11.7 [3.9]; 95% confidence interval for the difference between group means [-7.9 to -3.2]; P<0.0001). This difference did not persist after extubation, with similar mean LUSs in women who had received intraoperative lung protection (7.0 [4.1]), compared with women randomised to receive ZEEP (7.7 [3.1]).

In the present study, an infrared (IR) thermal camera was used to map the temperature of the target skin surface, and the resulting thermal image was evaluated for the presence of carotid artery stenosis (CAS). In the presence of stenosis in the carotid artery, abnormal temperature maps are expected to occur on the external skin surface, which could be captured and quantified using IR thermography. A Duplex Ultrasound (DUS) examination was used to establish the ground truth. In each patient, the background-subtracted thermal image, referred to as full thermal image, was used to extract novel parametric cold thermal feature images. From these images, statistical features, viz., correlation, energy, homogeneity, contrast, entropy, mean, standard deviation (SD), skewness, and kurtosis, were calculated and the two groups of patients (control and diseased: a total of 80 carotid artery samples) were classified. Both cut-off value- and support vector machine (SVM)-based binary classification models were tested. While the cut-off value classification model resulted in a moderate performance (70% accurate), SVM was found to have classified the patients with high accuracy (92% or higher).

A 45-min additional session of conventional occupational therapy (OT) or a VG-based OT session as add-on therapy to usual rehabilitation programs, 5 days/week for 6 weeks. Primary outcome: UL-FMS. Secondary outcome: Box and Block Test (BBT), Wolf Motor Function test (WMFT), Motor Activity Log (MAL), Barthel Index and quality of life (SF-36). We included 51 patients (20 women) at a mean (SD) of 27.2 (19.4) days post-stroke (mean age 58 years [range 24-83]), 26 in the CR group and 25 in the VG group (23 in each group at 6-month follow-up). The mean duration of the additional rehabilitation session was similar in both groups: 29.3 (4.3) vs 28.0 (4.4) min in CR and VG groups. Shoulder pain occurred in 4 patients in the VG group versus 7 in the CR group. At day 45, gain in UL-FMS did not significantly differ between the groups (CR mean 17.8 [14.6] vs VG 24.1 [14.8]; P=0.10), whereas gain in BBT was doubled in the VG group (CR 7.4 [12.2] vs VG 15.7 [16.3]; P=0.02). At 6-month follow-up, the study was inconclusive about between-group differences in UL-FMS, BBT and other criteria. Post-hoc analysis showed that gains in UL-FMS or BBT were significantly higher in the VG than CR group for patients included within 30 days post-stroke. In general, we cannot conclude that video gaming and conventional OT led to different long-term sensorimotor recovery of the UL after sub-acute stroke.

Multiple approaches have been devised for pain control in patients undergoing thyroid surgery, with local wound infiltration (LWI) of analgesia and bilateral superficial cervical plexus block (BSCPB) among the popular choices cited. However, the results comparing these methods had either been contradictory or equivocal. This study was carried out to assess the efficacy of BSCPB in comparison to LWI in reducing post-operative pain, as well as any additional opioid requirement in the first 24 h after thyroid surgery.

The aim of this study is to determine if presence of very short-lasting episodes of AF-like activity (micro-AF) can also be used as a marker of undiagnosed silent atrial fibrillation. In the STROKESTOP II study, a Swedish mass screening study for AF among 75- and 76-year-olds, participants with NT-proBNP ≥125 ng/L performed intermittent ECG recordings 30 s, four times daily for 2 weeks. Participants with micro-AF (sudden onset of irregular tachycardia with episodes of ≥5 consecutive supraventricular beats and total absence of p-waves, lasting less than 30 s) were invited to undergo extended AF screening using continuous event recording for 2 weeks. A control group of individuals without micro-AF was examined using the same ECG modalities. Out of 3763 participants in STROKESTOP II who had elevated NT-proBNP levels and were free of AF, n = 221 (6%) had micro-AF. The majority of participants with micro-AF (n = 196) accepted further investigation with continuous ECG monitoring which showed presence of AF in 26 of them. In the control group (n = 250), continuous monitoring detected 7 new AF cases. Thus, AF was significantly more common in the micro AF group (13%) compared to the control group (3%), p < 0.001. Presence of short-lasting episodes of AF-like activity (micro-AF) indicates increased likelihood for undetected AF.

To investigate the prognostic value of lymph node ratio (LNR), as well as the correlation with docetaxel, cisplatin, and 5-FU (TPF) induction chemotherapy, in patients with locally advanced oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Two-hundred and forty-five patients from a phase 3 trial involving TPF induction chemotherapy in stage III/IVA OSCC patients (NCT01542931) were enrolled in this study between 2008 and 2010. The clinical and pathological data were collected and analyzed. The cutoff value for LNR was calculated on the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression models, and Kaplan-Meier method were used for survival analysis. According to the ROC curve, the cutoff value for LNR was 7.6%. With a median follow-up period of 80 months, the OSCC patients with high-risk LNR (> 7.6%), or positive extranodal extension (ENE) had significantly worse clinical outcomes than patients with low-risk LNR (≤7.6%) or negative ENE. Multivariate analysis on pathological covariates showed that only high-risk LNR was an independent negative predictive factor for survival (P < .05). The cutoff value of LNR of 7.6% was also verified with the similar results using an open TCGA database, high-risk LNR indicating worse overall survival (P < .001) and disease-free survival (P < .001).

Cerebral palsy (CP) is a syndrome of childhood movement and posture disorders. Clinical evidence is still limited and sometimes inconclusive about the benefits of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSCs) for CP. We conducted a randomized trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of hUC-MSC transplantation concomitant with rehabilitation in patients with CP. Eligible patients were allocated into the hUC-MSC group and control group. In addition to rehabilitation, the patients in the hUC-MSC group received four transfusions of hUC-MSCs intravenously, while the control group received a placebo. Adverse events (AEs) were collected for safety evaluation in the 12-month follow-up phase. Primary endpoints were assessed as activities of daily living (ADL), comprehensive function assessment (CFA), and gross motor function measure (GMFM) scales. In addition, cerebral metabolic activity was detected by  18 F-FDG-PET/CT to explore the possible mechanism of the therapeutic effects. Primary endpoint data were analyzed by ANOVA using SPSS version 20.0. Forty patients were enrolled, and 1 patient withdrew informed consent. Therefore, 39 patients received treatments and completed the scheduled assessments. No significant difference was shown between the 2 groups in AE incidence. Additionally, significant improvements in ADL, CFA, and GMFM were observed in the hUC-MSC group compared with the control group. In addition, the standard uptake value of  18 F-FDG was markedly increased in 3 out of 5 patients from the hUC-MSC group at 12 months after transplantation. Our clinical data showed that hUC-MSC transplantation was safe and effective at improving the gross motor and comprehensive function of children with CP when combined with rehabilitation.

We examined the effects of empagliflozin on renal sodium and glucose handling in patients with acute HF. This study was a pre-defined sub-study of a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicentre study (EMPA-RESPONSE-AHF). Patients were allocated within 24 h of an acute HF admission to either empagliflozin 10 mg/day (n = 40) or placebo (n = 39) for 30 days.

To examine whether subconcussive head impacts cause impairments in neuro-ophthalmologic function as measured by the King-Devick test (KDT) and oculomotor function as measured by the near point of convergence. In this randomized clinical trial, adult soccer players were randomized into either a heading group or kicking (control) group. The heading group executed 10 headers with soccer balls projected at a speed of 25 mph. The kicking-control group followed the same protocol but with 10 kicks. Peak linear and rotational head accelerations were assessed with a triaxial accelerometer. The KDT speed and error and near point of convergence were assessed at baseline (preheading or prekicking) and at 0, 2, and 24 hours after heading or kicking. Ten soccer-ball headings or kicks. The primary outcome was the group-by-time interaction of KDT speed at 0 hours after heading or kicking. The secondary outcomes included KDT speed at 2 hours and 24 hours after heading or kicking, KDT error, and near point of convergence. A total of 78 individuals enrolled (heading group, n = 40; kicking-control group, n = 38).

As the detrimental effects of hypoxia are partly related to the induction of an immunosuppressive microenvironment, we investigated the interaction between tumor hypoxia dynamics and the PD-1/PD-L1 axis in HNSCC patients undergoing chemoradiation and its relevance for patient outcomes in a prospective trial. Methods: 49 patients treated with definitive chemoradiation for locally advanced HNSCC were enrolled in this trial and received longitudinal hypoxia PET imaging using fluorine-18 misonidazole ([ 18 F]FMISO) at weeks 0, 2 and 5 during treatment. Pre-therapeutic tumor biopsies were immunohistochemically analyzed regarding the PD-1/PD-L1 expression both on immune cells and on tumor cells, and potential correlations between the PD-1/PD-L1 axis and tumor hypoxia dynamics during chemoradiation were assessed using Spearman's rank correlations. Hypoxia dynamics during treatment were quantified by subtracting the standardized uptake value (SUV) index at baseline from the SUV values at weeks 2 or 5, whereby SUV index was defined as ratio of maximum tumor [ 18 F]FMISO SUV to mean SUV in the contralateral sternocleidomastoid muscle (i.e. tumor-to-muscle ratio).

Results: Neither PD-L1 nor PD-1 expression levels on tumor-infiltrating immune cells influenced LRC (HR = 0.734; p = 0.480 for PD-L1, HR = 0.991; p = 0.989 for PD-1), PFS (HR = 0.813; p = 0.597 for PD-L1, HR = 0.796; p = 0.713 for PD-1) or OS (HR = 0.698; p = 0.405 for PD-L1, HR = 0.315; p = 0.265 for PD-1). However, patients with no hypoxia resolution between weeks 0 and 2 and PD-L1 expression on tumor cells, quantified by a tumor proportional score (TPS) of at least 1%, showed significantly worse LRC (HR = 3.374, p = 0.022) and a trend towards reduced PFS (HR = 2.752, p = 0.052). In the multivariate Cox regression analysis, the combination of absent tumor hypoxia resolution and high tumoral PD-L1 expression remained a significant prognosticator for impaired LRC (HR = 3.374, p = 0.022). On the other side, tumoral PD-L1 expression did not compromise the outcomes of patients whose tumor-associated hypoxia declined between week 0 and 2 during chemoradiation (LRC: HR = 1.186, p = 0.772, PFS: HR = 0.846, p = 0.766). Conclusion: In this exploratory analysis, we showed for the first time that patients with both persistent tumor-associated hypoxia during treatment and PD-L1 expression on tumor cells exhibited a worse outcome, while the tumor cells' PD-L1 expression did not influence the outcomes of patients with early tumor hypoxia resolution. While the results have to be validated in an independent cohort, these findings form a foundation to investigate the combination of hypoxic modification and immune checkpoint inhibitors for the unfavorable subgroup, moving forward towards personalized radiation oncology treatment.", "label": [[113, 190, "P"], [0, 71, "I"], [93, 109, "X"], [193, 216, "I"], [232, 250, "X"], [254, 291, "P"], [300, 348, "I"], [362, 383, "X"], [541, 587, "I"], [591, 631, "P"], [707, 781, "P"], [823, 938, "I"], [1655, 1810, "X"], [1575, 1651, "I"], [3171, 3452, "B"]]}

One random quadrant of the maxilla/mandible underwent 810 nm gallium-aluminum-arsenide laser (infrared spectrum, 200 mW, 12 J/cm 2 , 60-second irradiation time of each point, continuous-wave mode), while the laser handpiece was used in off mode for the other quadrant, postoperatively. The patients underwent LLLT at 1, 5, 10, and 14 days, postoperatively. The blink test was performed to assess the function of the trigeminal nerve, and the 2-point discrimination (TPD) test was performed to assess the recovery of the inferior alveolar nerve (IAN) and the infraorbital nerves at 30 and 90 days, postoperatively. Data were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test (alpha = 0.05). Six women and 6 men were evaluated (mean age = 23.41 ± 5.03 years). Both groups showed significant improvement in function of the IAN and infraorbital nerves, postoperatively in blink reflex test (P < .05). In the TPD test, although both groups showed significant improvement of the IAN compared with the baseline (P < .05), the IAN showed significantly greater improvement by 1.1% in the laser group (P = .036). The percentage of change was significantly smaller in the laser group in R1 (by 14%; P = .025) and R2C wavelengths of the IAN and in the TPD test of the IAN (by 20%; P = .021), showing significantly greater improvement in laser group.

The optimal management of patients with tandem lesions (TL), or cervical internal carotid artery (c-ICA) steno-occlusive pathology and ipsilateral intracranial occlusion, who are undergoing endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) remains unknown. We sought to establish the feasibility of a trial designed to address this question. The Endovascular Acute Stroke Intervention (EASI) study was a single-centre randomized trial comparing EVT to medical therapy for large-vessel occlusion stroke. Patients with TL receiving EVT were randomly allocated to acute c-ICA stenting or no stenting.

{"id": 312, "data": "The N-AcetylCysteine and RAMipril in Takotsubo Syndrome Trial (NACRAM): Rationale and design of a randomised controlled trial of sequential N-Acetylcysteine and ramipril for the management of Takotsubo Syndrome. Takotsubo Syndrome(TTS), contrary to historical reports, is now increasingly recognised to be associated with substantial mortality and morbidity, both in the short- and long-term. Although TTS is often precipitated by a catecholamine pulse, in-hospital hypotension is a common occurrence, increasing the risk of mortality. Furthermore, despite the transient catecholamine stimulus, there is increasing evidence that there are significant long term sequelae, including persistently impaired left ventricular(LV) systolic dysfunction, myocardial oedema with fibrosis, as well as persistent impairment of quality of life. A definitive therapeutic option to limit the extent of initial myocardial injury, and to accelerate recovery in TTS is therefore justified. However to date, there has been a lack of prospective studies in this area. NACRAM is a multi-centre, randomised, placebo-controlled trial, sequentially testing early use of intravenous N-acetylcysteine(NAC), followed by/or oral ramipril for 12 weeks. The rationale for utilising these agents is related to their effects on limiting nitrosative stress and expression of the inflammasome activator thioredoxin interacting protein(TXNIP); both processes fundamental to the pathogenesis of TTS. NACRAM is assessing resolution of myocardial oedema on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging(CMR), improvements in LV systolic function as measured by global longitudinal strain(GLS) on echocardiography, quality of life, and inflammatory markers.

Rationale: To test whether novel biomarkers, such as microribonucleic acids (miRNAs), and nonstandard predictive models, such as decision tree learning, provide useful information for medical decision-making in patients on hemodialysis (HD). Methods: Samples from patients with end-stage renal disease receiving HD included in the AURORA trial were investigated (n=810). The study included two independent phases: phase I (matched cases and controls, n=410) and phase II (unmatched cases and controls, n=400).

The CART algorithm was used to construct regression tree models. A bagging-based procedure was used for validation. Results: In phase I, miRNA sequencing in a subset of samples (n=20) revealed miR-632 as a candidate (fold change=2.9). miR-632 was associated with the endpoint, even after adjusting for confounding factors (HR from 1.43 to 1.53).

We performed a subanalysis of a randomised controlled study [the REx trial; www.isrctn.com ; 62859294] to assess the potential of prehabilitation to modify muscle mass in patients having neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NACRT). Patients scheduled for NACRT, then potentially curative surgery (August 2014-March 2016) had baseline physical assessment and psoas muscle mass measurement (total psoas index using computed tomography-based measurements).

Four years after the original Grupo de Investigación en Salud Móvil en America Latina (GISMAL) study, we attempted to contact the 212 individuals originally enrolled in the study in Peru. The primary outcomes were systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels and hypertension incidence. Secondary outcome measures were body weight, BMI, and self-reported target behaviors. The study personnel collecting the data were masked to the group assignment. Linear mixed models were used to evaluate the effects of the intervention on primary and secondary outcomes in an intention-to-treat analysis. Data from 164 (77.4%) of the 212 originally enrolled participants were available and analyzed (80 in the intervention group and 84 in the control group).

The intervention reduced the risk of developing hypertension, but the result was not significant (risk ratio (RR) 0.76, 95% CI 0.45-1.28). However, those who received the intervention had lower body weight (-5.42 kg, 95% CI -10.4 to -0.48) and BMI (-2.56 kg/m2, 95% CI -4.46 to -0.66).

A total of 40 patients aged 10.7-19.5 years were included. The side and method of application were both randomized. Heart rate was recorded, and discomfort and pain were evaluated with a visual analogue scale (VAS). A paired t-test was used to compare mean values, a chi 2  test was used to compare proportions, and a Pearson correlation test was used to examine correlations between variables. When ice was used, buccal injection VAS pain was rated lower (p = 0.044), and VAS discomfort was rated higher (p = 0.001), in comparison to when lidocaine 5% gel was used. There was no significant difference in relative heart rate change between ice and lidocaine 5% gel at either needle stick or injection. Lidocaine 5% gel produced a relative heart rate reduction after palatal injection (0.99 ± 0.06) while buccal injection produced an increased relative heart rate (1.02 ± 0.08) (p = 0.010). Unpleasant taste was more frequently reported when lidocaine 5% gel was used (p = 0.025). An application time of 1 min was sufficient for both ice and lidocaine 5% gel to achieve pain reduction from needle stick in buccal mucosa.

{"id": 322, "data": "Minimally invasive far lateral debridement combined with posterior instrumentation for thoracic and lumbar tuberculosis without severe kyphosis. Anti-tuberculous therapy (ATT) alone cannot easily cure spine tuberculosis (STB) though it is the most essential treatment. Many studies have confirmed the efficacy of the surgical treatment of STB through anterior, anterolateral, posterior debridement, and intervertebral fusion or combined with internal fixation. However, the conventional surgical approach requires extensive exposure of the affected areas with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Recently, minimally invasive surgery has come into use to reduce iatrogenic trauma and relevant complications. Here, we introduced a novel technique for the treatment of thoracic and lumbar spine tuberculosis: minimally invasive far lateral debridement and posterior instrumentation (MI-FLDPI). In this study, we evaluated the technical feasibility, the clinical outcomes, and the postoperative complications. We did a prospective, non-randomized study on this new technique. Twenty three patients (13 males) with thoracic or lumbar spine tuberculosis who underwent minimally invasive far lateral debridement and posterior instrumentation were included in the study. The preoperative comorbidities, operation duration, intra-operative hemorrhage, Cobb's angles, and postoperative complications were recorded and analyzed. Clinical outcomes were evaluated by Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), neurological recovery, and eradication of tuberculosis. Radiological outcomes were evaluated by changes in Cobb's angle and fusion status of the affected segments. The patients were followed for an average of 19 months (ranging from 12 to 36 months). At the final follow-up, CRP and ESR of all patients were normal. The VAS and ODI were significantly improved compared with preoperative values (P < 0.05). No evident progression of the kyphotic deformity was found after surgery. Twenty two patients showed spontaneous peripheral interbody fusion 1 year after surgery. There were no failure of the instrumentation even though a young female with drug-resistant tuberculosis showed no sign of interbody fusion at the third year follow-up. All the patients with preoperative neurological deficit showed complete recovery at the final follow-up. MI-FLDPI using expandable tubular retractor could be recommended to treat thoracic and lumbar spine tuberculosis for the advantages of less trauma, earlier recovery, and less complications.

The known physical characteristics of morphine that allow absorption are counter to the unproven belief that sublingual morphine is absorbed more quickly.

Ten participants with cancer (mean age, 50 ± 12 years) received a 10-mg morphine tablet in a randomized crossover design with repeated premeasure and postmeasure for 60 minutes. Measures included PMC and visual analog scale (100 mm) scores for pain relief and taste. Interindividual variability in maximum PMC was 25-fold (2.2-55 ng/mL). At 60 minutes, sublingual and swallowed routes were not significantly different for mean area under the curve for PMC (swallowed, 329 ± 314 ng/mL; sublingual, 314 ± 299 ng/mL) or for mean pain relief scores (swallowed, 81 ± 32; sublingual, 78 ± 31).

Given the 25-fold across-participant differences in PMC after the same dose, additional research is warranted to identify the sources of this tremendous variability in PMC.

This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of using a mobile phone application (app) versus telephone operator assistance in performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) techniques in simulated settings. A comparative study was performed with 2 intervention groups: (1) mobile phone app and (2) telephone assistance. A total of 128 students participated and were distributed randomly into each intervention group. A CPR observation checklist and standard CPR quality parameter measurements were used for data collection. The group that used the app obtained better results than the group that had telephone assistance on 5 items during CPR observation: checking if the area is secure (X 2 (1) = 26.81; P < 0.05), asking for help (X 2 (1) = 66.07; P < 0.05), opening of airways (X 2 (1) = 12.03; P < 0.05), checking for breathing (X 2 (1) = 6.10; P < 0.05), and contacting emergency services (X 2 (1) = 12.41; P < 0.05).

We have previously reported that in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) consumption of a very low carbohydrate diet capable of inducing nutritional ketosis over 2 years (continuous care intervention, CCI) resulted in improved body weight, glycemic control, and multiple risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) with the exception of an increase in low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). In the present study, we report the impact of this intervention on markers of risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD), with a focus on lipoprotein subfraction particle concentrations as well as carotid-artery intima-media thickness (CIMT). Analyses were performed in patients with T2D who completed 2 years of this study (CCI; n = 194; usual care (UC): n = 68). Lipoprotein subfraction particle concentrations were measured by ion mobility at baseline, 1, and 2 years and CIMT was measured at baseline and 2 years. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to assess changes in independent clusters of lipoprotein particles. At 2 years, CCI resulted in a 23% decrease of small LDL IIIb and a 29% increase of large LDL I with no change in total LDL particle concentration or ApoB. The change in proportion of smaller and larger LDL was reflected by reversal of the small LDL subclass phenotype B in a high proportion of CCI participants (48.1%) and a shift in the principal component (PC) representing the atherogenic lipoprotein phenotype characteristic of T2D from a major to a secondary component of the total variance. The increase in LDL-C in the CCI group was mainly attributed to larger cholesterol-enriched LDL particles. CIMT showed no change in either the CCI or UC group. Consumption of a very low carbohydrate diet with nutritional ketosis for 2 years in patients with type 2 diabetes lowered levels of small LDL particles that are commonly increased in diabetic dyslipidemia and are a marker for heightened CVD risk. A corresponding increase in concentrations of larger LDL particles was responsible for higher levels of plasma LDL-C. The lack of increase in total LDL particles, ApoB, and in progression of CIMT, provide supporting evidence that this dietary intervention did not adversely affect risk of CVD.", "label": [[51, 89, "X"], [93, 122, "P"], [28, 47, "I"], [589, 774, "X"], [213, 328, "I"], [803, 856, "P"], [898, 1161, "X"], [1820, 2066, "B"]]}

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is widely prevalent, associated with morbidity and mortality, but may be lessened with timely implementation of evidence-based strategies including blood pressure (BP) control. Nonetheless, an evidence-practice gap persists. We synthesize the evidence for clinician-facing interventions to improve hypertension management in CKD patients in primary care. Electronic databases and related publications were queried for relevant studies. We used a conceptual model to address heterogeneity of interventions. We conducted a quantitative synthesis of interventions on blood pressure (BP) outcomes and a narrative synthesis of other CKD relevant clinical outcomes. Planned subgroup analyses were performed by (1) study design (randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or nonrandomized studies (NRS)); (2) intervention type (guideline-concordant decision support, shared care, pharmacist-facing); and (3) use of behavioral/implementation theory. Of 2704 manuscripts screened, 73 underwent full-text review; 22 met inclusion criteria. BP target achievement was reported in 15 and systolic BP reduction in 6 studies. Among RCTs, all interventions had a significant effect on BP control, (pooled OR 1.21; 95% CI 1.07 to 1.38). Subgroup analysis by intervention type showed significant effects for guideline-concordant decision support (pooled OR 1.19; 95% CI 1.12 to 1.27) but not shared care (pooled OR 1.71; 95% CI 0.96 to 3.03) or pharmacist-facing interventions (pooled OR 1.04; 95% CI 0.82 to 1.34). Subgroup analysis finding was replicated with pooling of RCTs and NRS. The five contributing studies showed large and significant reduction in systolic BP (pooled WMD - 3.86; 95% CI - 7.2 to - 0.55). Use of a behavioral/implementation theory had no impact, while RCTs showed smaller effect sizes than NRS.

The aim of this preregistered, secondary analysis of a pilot randomized controlled trial (NCT02717429) was to compare the impact of 4-week mindfulness-based training and adaptive cognitive training, with a waitlist control condition, on processing speed and working memory in people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS). Sixty-one PwMS were randomized to mindfulness-based training (MBT), adaptive computerized cognitive training (aCT), or a waitlist (WL) control group and completed the Brief Repeatable Battery of Neuropsychological Tests at pre- and posttraining. Training-related changes on the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) and the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT) were the primary outcomes of interest. Baseline cognitive status was examined as a moderator of treatment gains. Practice time, change in aCT game difficulty, and rate of change in state awareness across MBT were assessed as correlates of cognitive gains. Compared with aCT and WL, mindfulness training significantly improved processing speed (ηp² = .14). Baseline cognitive status did not moderate change in processing speed (ηp² = .005) or working memory (ηp² = .014). Practice time and change in game difficulty were not significantly correlated with cognitive gains (all ps > .49). In the MBT group, rate of change in awareness was significantly associated with improvement in working memory (ρ = .52, p = .04). In PwMS, 4 weeks of mindfulness meditation training improved processing speed above and beyond aCT and WL.

Options for further treatment are repeat urethrotomy or open urethroplasty. To compare the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of urethrotomy with open urethroplasty in adult men with recurrent bulbar urethral stricture. This was an open label, two-arm, patient-randomised controlled trial. UK National Health Service hospitals were recruited and 222 men were randomised to receive urethroplasty or urethrotomy. Urethrotomy is a minimally invasive technique whereby the narrowed area is progressively widened by cutting the scar tissue with a steel blade mounted on a urethroscope. Urethroplasty is a more invasive surgery to reconstruct the narrowed area. The primary outcome was the profile over 24 mo of a patient-reported outcome measure, the voiding symptom score. The main clinical outcome was time until reintervention. The primary analysis included 69 (63%) and 90 (81%) of those allocated to urethroplasty and urethrotomy, respectively.

People with multiple sclerosis have problems with memory and attention. The effectiveness of cognitive rehabilitation has not been established. The objectives were to assess the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a cognitive rehabilitation programme for people with multiple sclerosis. This was a multicentre, randomised controlled trial in which participants were randomised in a ratio of 6 : 5 to receive cognitive rehabilitation plus usual care or usual care alone. Participants were assessed at 6 and 12 months after randomisation. The trial was set in hospital neurology clinics and community services. Participants were people with multiple sclerosis who had cognitive problems, were aged 18-69 years, could travel to attend group sessions and gave informed consent. The intervention was a group cognitive rehabilitation programme delivered weekly by an assistant psychologist to between four and six participants for 10 weeks. The primary outcome was the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale - Psychological subscale at 12 months. Secondary outcomes included results from the Everyday Memory Questionnaire, the 30-Item General Health Questionnaire, the EuroQol-5 Dimensions, five-level version and a service use questionnaire from participants, and the Everyday Memory Questionnaire - relative version and the Modified Carer Strain Index from a relative or friend of the participant. Of the 449 participants randomised, 245 were allocated to cognitive rehabilitation (intervention group) and 204 were allocated to usual care (control group). Of these, 214 in the intervention group and 173 in the control group were included in the primary analysis. There was no clinically important difference in the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale - Psychological subscale score between the two groups at the 12-month follow-up (adjusted difference in means -0.6, 95% confidence interval -1.5 to 0.3; p = 0.20). There were no important differences between the groups in relation to cognitive abilities, fatigue, employment, or carer strain at follow-up.

Cognitive (or mental processing) problems, particularly those affecting memory and attention, are common in people with multiple sclerosis. Multiple sclerosis is a condition that affects the brain and causes nerve damage. Cognitive rehabilitation can involve: retraining cognitive skills, which are the core skills your brain uses to think, read, learn, remember, reason and concentrateteaching strategies to cope in daily life. Cognitive rehabilitation is rarely provided for people with multiple sclerosis. A trial was carried out to determine whether or not providing a group cognitive rehabilitation programme improved quality of life more than usual clinical care, which did not involve any cognitive rehabilitation. The effects on daily memory problems, mood, fatigue and employment were examined and also the cost-effectiveness of the treatment. A total of 449 people with multiple sclerosis took part in the trial. They all agreed to be part of the research trial, had cognitive problems, were aged 18–69 years and could travel to attend group sessions. Participants were then allocated to receive cognitive rehabilitation or not, on the basis of chance (i.e. randomly). All participants were followed up for 1 year. Although both groups showed no differences in quality of life after 1 year, those who received cognitive rehabilitation had fewer memory problems in daily life and reported better mood than those who received only their usual clinical care. There were no differences in their levels of fatigue or disability, or in employment status. The qualitative results indicated that participants found the intervention useful. Treatment cost slightly less than usual care but had modest benefits.

This study aimed to investigate the anti-hypoxic activities of dexamethasone to understand a possible mechanism of its action in hypoxia-induced lethality through experimental models of hypoxia. In this investigation, 84 Male BALB/c mice were randomly divided into groups of seven (12 groups). Treatment groups received 10 days of dexamethasone intraperitoneal injection at both human dose (~0.1 mg/kg) and the animal does (~1 mg/kg). Control negative and positive groups were treated with 10 ml/kg of normal saline and 30 mg/kg of propranolol, respectively. Three experimental models of hypoxia, asphyctic, circulatory, and hemic were applied in this study. The findings showed that dexamethasone significantly prolonged the latency for death in the asphyctic model concerning the control group in both humans (P < .0001) and animal dose (P < .0001). The results were also highly significant for both doses in the hemic model (P < .001). In the circulatory model, although a small increase was observed in death prolongation, results were not statistically significant for both doses in this model (P > .05). This experimental in vivo investigation demonstrated an excellent protective effect for 10 days of dexamethasone treatment against hypoxia, especially in asphyctic and hemic models. In addition to promising dexamethasone outcomes, using propranolol as the positive control illustrated a very substantial anti-hypoxic effect even much better than dexamethasone in all models. It seems that propranolol would be a safe, potential, and prudent choice to invest in treating COVID-19 patients.", "label": [[0, 13, "I"], [318, 341, "X"], [345, 358, "I"], [503, 519, "P"], [576, 715, "I"], [717, 839, "C"], [1392, 1573, "B"]]}

However, no randomised controlled trials are available to guide optimal management. We therefore aimed to assess whether an intensive systolic blood pressure target resulted in reduced rates of intraparenchymal haemorrhage compared with a standard systolic blood pressure target. We did a multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial at four academic hospital centres in France. Eligible individuals were adults (aged ≥18 years) with an acute ischaemic stroke due to a large-vessel occlusion that was successfully treated with endovascular therapy. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to either an intensive systolic blood pressure target group (100-129 mm Hg) or a standard care systolic blood pressure target group (130-185 mm Hg), by means of a central web-based procedure, stratified by centre and intravenous thrombolysis use before endovascular therapy. In both groups, the target systolic blood pressure had to be achieved within 1 h after randomisation and maintained for 24 h with intravenous blood pressure lowering treatments. The primary outcome was the rate of radiographic intraparenchymal haemorrhage at 24-36 h and the primary safety outcome was the occurrence of hypotension.

Between June 21, 2017, and Sept 27, 2019, 324 patients were enrolled in the four participating stroke centres: 162 patients were randomly assigned to the intensive target group and 162 to the standard target group. Four (2%) of 162 patients were excluded from the intensive target group and two (1%) of 162 from the standard target group for withdrawal of consent or legal reasons. The mean systolic blood pressure during the first 24 h after reperfusion was 128 mm Hg (SD 11) in the intensive target group and 138 mm Hg (17) in the standard target group.

Patients with MYD88L265P disease were randomly assigned 1:1 to treatment with ibrutinib or zanubrutinib. The primary end point was the proportion of patients achieving a complete response (CR) or a very good partial response (VGPR) by independent review. Key secondary end points included major response rate (MRR), progression-free survival (PFS), duration of response (DOR), disease burden, and safety. A total of 201 patients were randomized, and 199 received ≥1 dose of study treatment. No patient achieved a CR. Twenty-nine (28%) zanubrutinib patients and 19 (19%) ibrutinib patients achieved a VGPR, a nonstatistically significant difference (P = .09). MRRs were 77% and 78%, respectively. Median DOR and PFS were not reached; 84% and 85% of ibrutinib and zanubrutinib patients were progression free at 18 months. Atrial fibrillation, contusion, diarrhea, peripheral edema, hemorrhage, muscle spasms, and pneumonia, as well as adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation, were less common among zanubrutinib recipients. Incidence of neutropenia was higher with zanubrutinib, although grade ≥3 infection rates were similar in both arms (1.2 and 1.1 events per 100 person-months). These results demonstrate that zanubrutinib and ibrutinib are highly effective in the treatment of WM, but zanubrutinib treatment was associated with a trend toward better response quality and less toxicity, particularly cardiovascular toxicity.", "label": [[30, 42, "I"], [46, 55, "C"], [59, 100, "P"], [285, 304, "X"], [308, 351, "C"], [358, 410, "I"], [415, 431, "P"], [433, 465, "P"], [511, 520, "C"], [524, 536, "I"], [568, 836, "X"], [1626, 1871, "B"]]}

Serratus anterior plane block (SAPB) and intercostal nerve block (ICNB) are attractive options for multimodal analgesia in patients undergoing thoracoscopic surgery, but which block is superior remains unclear. The present study aimed to assess the effect of SAPB versus ICNB on reducing postoperative pain after video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) for lobectomy. This prospective, randomized, active-intervention-controlled, subject-assessor-blinded, single-center, parallel-group trial allocated 18- to 80-year-old patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists status I to III to receive either SAPB or ICNB in a 1:1 ratio. The primary outcome was numerical pain rating scale (NRS) scores during the first 24 hours postoperatively. The secondary outcomes were postoperative cumulative doses of ketorolac and fentanyl, and the occurrence of postoperative adverse effects. Among the 57 patients assessed for eligibility, 50 were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio. Due to conversion to open thoracotomy and patient-controlled analgesia pump failure, 4 patients were excluded and 46 were analyzed. The intergroup differences in NRS scores were not statistically significant at any time point. Cumulative consumptions of fentanyl and ketorolac were also not significantly different.

Worldwide, there are only few studies focusing on labor analgesia on the MLAC (minimum local analgesic concentration) or EC50 (median effective concentration) of sufentanil and ropivacaine. Therefore, we determine the MLAC or EC50 of sufentanil and ropivacaine for epidural analgesia by using an up-down sequential allocation and survey its adverse effect in a prospective blinded randomized trial. Sixty nulliparous full-term parturients who required labor analgesia were recruited and randomly divided into the sufentanil and ropivacaine groups. The formulation was 25 μg sufentanil combined with 0.1% ropivacaine (added 0.9% normal saline to 75 ml). According to the response of a previous parturient, the dosage of sufentanil was increased or decreased by 5 μg in the sufetanil group; meanwhile, we also administrated an initial concentration of 0.1% ropivacaine combined with 22.5 μg sufentanil (added 0.9% normal saline to 75 ml) in the ropivacaine group. The concentration of ropivacaine was increased or decreased by 0.01% following the response of the previous parturient.

Microvascular obstruction affects one-half of patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction and confers an adverse prognosis. This study aimed to determine whether the efficacy and safety of a therapeutic strategy involving low-dose intracoronary alteplase infused early after coronary reperfusion associates with ischemic time. This study was conducted in a prospective, multicenter, parallel group, 1:1:1 randomized, dose-ranging trial in patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention. Ischemic time, defined as the time from symptom onset to coronary reperfusion, was a pre-specified subgroup of interest. Between March 17, 2016, and December 21, 2017, 440 patients, presenting with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction within 6 h of symptom onset (<2 h, n = 107; ≥2 h but <4 h, n = 235; ≥4 h to 6 h, n = 98), were enrolled at 11 U.K. hospitals. Participants were randomly assigned to treatment with placebo (n = 151), alteplase 10 mg (n = 144), or alteplase 20 mg (n = 145). The primary outcome was the amount of microvascular obstruction (MVO) (percentage of left ventricular mass) quantified by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging at 2 to 7 days (available for 396 of 440). Overall, there was no association between alteplase dose and the extent of MVO (p for trend = 0.128). However, in patients with an ischemic time ≥4 to 6 h, alteplase increased the mean extent of MVO compared with placebo: 1.14% (placebo) versus 3.11% (10 mg) versus 5.20% (20 mg); p = 0.009 for the trend. The interaction between ischemic time and alteplase dose was statistically significant (p = 0.018). In patients presenting with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction and an ischemic time ≥4 to 6 h, adjunctive treatment with low-dose intracoronary alteplase during primary percutaneous coronary intervention was associated with increased MVO.

Walking is an easily prescribed physical activity for people with low back pain (LBP). However, the evidence for its effectiveness to improve pain and disability levels for people with chronic low back pain (CLBP) within a community setting has not been evaluated. This study evaluates the effectiveness of a clinician guided, pedometer-driven, walking intervention for increasing physical activity and improving clinical outcomes compared to education and advice. Randomized controlled trial recruiting N = 174 adults with CLBP. Participants were randomly allocated into either a standardized care group (SG) or pedometer based walking group (WG) using minimization allocation with a 2:1 ratio to the WG. Prior to randomization all participants were given a standard package of education and advice regarding self-management and the benefits of staying active. Following randomization the WG undertook a physiotherapist guided pedometer-driven walking program for 12 weeks. This was individually tailored by weekly negotiation of daily step targets. Main outcome was the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) recorded at baseline, 12 weeks, 6 and 12 months. Other outcomes included, numeric pain rating, International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), Fear-Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire (FABQ), Back Beliefs questionnaire (BBQ), Physical Activity Self-efficacy Scale, and EQ-5D-5L quality of life estimate. N = 138 (79%) participants completed all outcome measures at 12 weeks reducing to N = 96 (55%) at 12 months. Both observed and intention to treat analysis did not show any statistically significant difference in ODI change score between the WG and the SG at all post-intervention time points. There were also no significant between group differences for change scores in all secondary outcome measures. Post hoc sensitivity analyses revealed moderately disabled participants (baseline ODI ≥ 21.0) demonstrated a greater reduction in mean ODI scores at 12 months in the WG compared to SG, while WG participants with a daily baseline step count < 7500 steps demonstrated a greater reduction in mean ODI scores at 12 weeks. Overall, we found no significant difference in change of levels of (ODI) disability between the SG and WG following the walking intervention.

Pharmacogenetic testing evaluates patient DNA to determine if a drug is expected to have a normal clinical effect, heightened effect, or no effect at all on the patient. It also predicts whether patients are likely to experience side effects from medicine. We further sought to determine if changing the multimodal programme based on these results would improve pain control or reduce side effects. In this pilot study, buccal samples were collected from 31 primary TKA patients. Pharmacogenetics testing examined genetic variants in genes OPRM1, CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6. These genes affect the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opioids. We examined the frequency of genetic variants to any of the medications we prescribed including celecoxib, hydrocodone, and tramadol. Patients were randomized to one of two groups: the control group received the standard postoperative pain regimen, and the study group received a customized regimen based on the pharmacogenetic results. For the first ten postoperative days, patients recorded pain scores, medication, and side effects. Genetic variants involving one or more medications in the multimodal pain protocol occurred in 13 of the 31 patients (42%).

We then evaluated the delineation efficiency using the following parameters: accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, Dice's similarity coefficient, IOU, and kappa coefficient. Compared with the traditional level set algorithms, including C-V and GAC, the proposed model had higher efficiency in macular edema delineation as shown by reduced processing time and iteration times.

Central randomisation was done based on a computer-generated allocation sequence with variable block sizes of 2, 4, and 6, which was stratified by centre, diabetes status, and presence or absence of multivessel coronary artery disease, and concealed using a secure web-based system. Patients and treating physicians were aware of group allocations, whereas outcome assessors were masked to the allocated stent. The experimental stent (Orsiro; Biotronik; Bülach, Switzerland) consisted of an ultrathin strut cobalt-chromium metallic stent platform releasing sirolimus from a biodegradable polymer. The control stent (Xience Xpedition/Alpine; Abbott Vascular, Abbott Park, IL, USA) consisted of a thin strut cobalt-chromium stent platform that releases everolimus from a durable polymer. The primary endpoint was target lesion failure, a composite of cardiac death, target vessel myocardial reinfarction (Q-wave and non-Q-wave), and clinically-indicated target lesion revascularisation, within 12 months of the index procedure. All analyses were done with the individual participant as the unit of analysis and according to the intention-to-treat principle. The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02579031. Between April 26, 2016, and March 9, 2018, we randomly assigned 1300 patients (1623 lesions) with acute myocardial infarction to treatment with biodegradable polymer sirolimus-eluting stents (649 patients and 816 lesions) or durable polymer everolimus-eluting stents (651 patients and 806 lesions). At 12 months, follow-up data were available for 614 (95%) patients treated with biodegradable polymer sirolimus-eluting stents and 626 (96%) patients treated with durable polymer everolimus-eluting stents. The primary composite endpoint of target lesion failure occurred in 25 (4%) of 649 patients treated with biodegradable polymer sirolimus-eluting stents and 36 (6%) of 651 patients treated with durable polymer everolimus-eluting stents (difference -1·6 percentage points; rate ratio 0·59, 95% Bayesian credibility interval 0·37-0·94; posterior probability of superiority 0·986). Cardiac death, target vessel myocardial reinfarction, clinically-indicated target lesion revascularisation, and definite stent thrombosis were similar between the two treatment groups in the 12 months of follow-up. In patients with acute STEMI undergoing primary PCI, biodegradable polymer sirolimus-eluting stents were superior to durable polymer everolimus-eluting stents with respect to target lesion failure at 1 year. This difference was driven by reduced ischaemia-driven target lesion revascularisation in patients treated with biodegradable polymer sirolimus-eluting stents compared with durable polymer everolimus-eluting stents.

The first-in-class monoclonal antibody, zolbetuximab (formerly known as IMAB362), binds to CLDN18.2 and can induce immune-mediated lysis of CLDN18.2-positive cells. Patients with advanced gastric, gastro-oesophageal junction (GEJ) or oesophageal adenocarcinomas with moderate-to-strong CLDN18.2 expression in ≥50% of tumour cells received zolbetuximab intravenously every 2 weeks for five planned infusions.

The mean baseline PASI scores were 7.7 in the roflumilast 0.3% group, 8.0 in the roflumilast 0.15% group, and 7.6 in the vehicle group; the mean change from baseline at week 6 was -50.0%, -49.0%, and -17.8%, respectively. Application-site reactions occurred with similar frequency in the roflumilast groups and the vehicle group. Roflumilast cream administered once daily to affected areas of psoriasis was superior to vehicle cream in leading to a state of clear or almost clear at 6 weeks.

{"id": 398, "data": "Abrocitinib versus Placebo or Dupilumab for Atopic Dermatitis. The oral Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) inhibitor abrocitinib, which reduces interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 signaling, is being investigated for the treatment of atopic dermatitis. Data from trials comparing JAK1 inhibitors with monoclonal antibodies, such as dupilumab, that block interleukin-4 receptors are limited. In a phase 3, double-blind trial, we randomly assigned patients with atopic dermatitis that was unresponsive to topical agents or that warranted systemic therapy (in a 2:2:2:1 ratio) to receive 200 mg or 100 mg of abrocitinib orally once daily, 300 mg of dupilumab subcutaneously every other week (after a loading dose of 600 mg), or placebo; all the patients received topical therapy. The primary end points were an Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) response (defined as a score of 0 [clear] or 1 [almost clear] on the IGA [scores range from 0 to 4], with an improvement of ≥2 points from baseline) and an Eczema Area and Severity Index-75 (EASI-75) response (defined as ≥75% improvement from baseline in the score on the EASI [scores range from 0 to 72]) at week 12. The key secondary end points were itch response (defined as an improvement of ≥4 points in the score on the Peak Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale [scores range from 0 to 10]) at week 2 and IGA and EASI-75 responses at week 16. A total of 838 patients underwent randomization; 226 patients were assigned to the 200-mg abrocitinib group, 238 to the 100-mg abrocitinib group, 243 to the dupilumab group, and 131 to the placebo group. An IGA response at week 12 was observed in 48.4% of patients in the 200-mg abrocitinib group, 36.6% in the 100-mg abrocitinib group, 36.5% in the dupilumab group, and 14.0% in the placebo group (P<0.001 for both abrocitinib doses vs. placebo); an EASI-75 response at week 12 was observed in 70.3%, 58.7%, 58.1%, and 27.1%, respectively (P<0.001 for both abrocitinib doses vs. placebo). The 200-mg dose, but not the 100-mg dose, of abrocitinib was superior to dupilumab with respect to itch response at week 2. Neither abrocitinib dose differed significantly from dupilumab with respect to most other key secondary end-point comparisons at week 16. Nausea occurred in 11.1% of the patients in the 200-mg abrocitinib group and 4.2% of those in the 100-mg abrocitinib group, and acne occurred in 6.6% and 2.9%, respectively. In this trial, abrocitinib at a dose of either 200 mg or 100 mg once daily resulted in significantly greater reductions in signs and symptoms of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis than placebo at weeks 12 and 16. The 200-mg dose, but not the 100-mg dose, of abrocitinib was superior to dupilumab with respect to itch response at week 2.

The optimal duration of DAPT in ACS patients treated with DES is still unclear. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to investigate a short versus a standard 12-month DAPT regimen in ACS patients undergoing new-generation DES implantation. REDUCE was a prospective, open-label, multicentre, investigator-initiated study that randomised 1,496 ACS patients after treatment with the COMBO stent to either three (n=751) or 12 months (n=745) of DAPT. The primary study endpoint was a composite of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis, stroke, target vessel revascularisation and bleeding at 12 months. No difference was observed in the demographic and clinical characteristics between the two groups, except for gender (p=0.01). At one-year follow-up, non-inferiority of three- versus 12-month DAPT in the primary endpoint was met (8.2% vs 8.4%, pnon-inferiority<0.001). The similar outcome between the two groups was confirmed at two-year follow-up (11.6% vs 12.1%, p=0.76), with no significant difference in overall mortality (3.1% vs 2.2%, p=0.27), cardiac mortality (1.8% vs 1.1%, p=0.28), stent thrombosis (1.6% vs 0.8%, p=0.16) and major bleeding (3.3% vs 4.0%, p=0.46). The results show that, among ACS patients treated with the COMBO stent, three months is non-inferior to 12 months of DAPT. However, given the numerically higher rates of mortality and ST in the three-month DAPT group, one-year DAPT should still be recommended in ACS until more information becomes available.

To investigate the effect of a social robot intervention on sleep and motor activity in nursing home residents living with dementia and chronic pain. A pilot randomized controlled trial was conducted with 41 residents from three Australian nursing homes. People living with dementia and chronic pain were randomized into either a 30-minute daily social robot (PARO) condition or a usual care condition for six weeks. Sleep and motor activity were assessed by actigraphy at four-time points: week 0 at baseline, week one, week six, and after the intervention. Data were reduced into daytime (8:00am - 7:59pm) and night-time (8:00pm - 7:59am) summaries. Change scores for each time point compared with baseline were computed for data analysis and the generalized estimating equation model with imbalanced baseline values added as covariates were performed. At week one, residents in the PARO group had a greater increase in the night sleep period (1.81, 95 % CI: 0.22-3.84, p = 0.030, Cohen's d = 0.570).

Optimal treatment of patients with persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) and heart failure (HF) with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and an indication for internal defibrillator therapy is controversial. Patients with persistent/longstanding persistent AF and LVEF ≤35% were randomly allocated to catheter ablation of AF or best medical therapy (BMT). The primary study end point was the absolute increase in LVEF from baseline at 1 year. Secondary end points included 6-minute walk test, quality-of-life, and NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide). Pulmonary vein isolation was the primary ablation approach; BMT comprised rate or rhythm control. All patients were discharged after index hospitalization with a cardioverter-defibrillator or cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator implanted. The study was terminated early for futility. Of 140 patients (65±8 years, 126 [90%] men) available for the end point analysis, 68 and 72 patients were assigned to ablation and BMT, respectively. At 1 year, LVEF had increased in ablation patients by 8.8% (95% CI, 5.8%-11.9%) and in BMT patients by 7.3% (4.3%-10.3%; P=0.36). Sinus rhythm was recorded on 12-lead electrocardiograms at 1 year in 61/83 ablation patients (73.5%) and 42/84 BMT patients (50%). Device-recorded AF burden at 1 year was 0% or maximally 5% of the time in 28/39 ablation patients (72%) and 16/36 BMT patients (44%). There was no difference in secondary end point outcome between ablation patients and BMT patients. The AMICA trial (Atrial Fibrillation Management in Congestive Heart Failure With Ablation) did not reveal any benefit of catheter ablation in patients with AF and advanced HF. This was mainly because of the fact that at 1 year, LVEF increased in ablation patients to a similar extent as in BMT patients. The effect of catheter ablation of AF in patients with HF may be affected by the extent of HF at baseline, with a rather limited ablation benefit in patients with seriously advanced HF.

There is rising interest in remote clinical trial assessments, particularly in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic. To demonstrate the feasibility, reliability, and value of remote visits in a phase III clinical trial of individuals with Parkinson's disease. We invited individuals with Parkinson's disease enrolled in a phase III clinical trial (STEADY-PD III) to enroll in a sub-study of remote video-based visits. Participants completed three remote visits over one year within four weeks of an in-person visit and completed assessments performed during the remote visit. We evaluated the ability to complete scheduled assessments remotely; agreement between remote and in-person outcome measures; and opinions of remote visits. We enrolled 40 participants (mean (SD) age 64.3 (10.4), 29% women), and 38 (95%) completed all remote visits. There was excellent correlation (ICC 0.81-0.87) between remote and in-person patient-reported outcomes, and moderate correlation (ICC 0.43-0.51) between remote and in-person motor assessments. On average, remote visits took around one quarter of the time of in-person visits (54 vs 190 minutes).

The management of the diagnosis and treatment processes for such side effects may facilitate the continuation of chemotherapy and enhance the patient's quality of life. The objective of this study is to report the cutaneous side effects of EGFR inhibitors and to share treatment methods for such side effects. In this prospective study, 59 patients using EGFR due to breast and colorectal carcinoma at the oncology unit of Haseki Training and Research Hospital were assessed. The patients for whom EGFR was initiated were examined at the beginning of the treatment at weeks 1 and 2, their demographic characteristics were recorded, and the patients who developed a skin rash were followed up from the onset of the lesion. The PPL side effects that developed in the patients and other dermatological findings were recorded. The PPL side effects were graded, and the treatment plans were reported. The study was conducted between February 2016 and February 2018 under the approval of the local ethical committee. The mean age of the 59 patients (47 females, 12 males) taking EGFR inhibitors was 52.4 ± 12.0 (range: 29-84). Forty-five patients had early stage and 14 patients had advanced stage carcinoma. Fourteen patients had colorectal carcinoma, three patients had renal cancer, and 42 patients had breast cancer.

To understand the early outcomes after hip arthroscopy and better define the trajectory of improvement in a prospective cohort of patients who have undergone hip arthroscopic osteochondroplasty for femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) syndrome. Data were analyzed from the Femoroacetabular Impingement RandomiSed controlled Trial (FIRST) on the 108 study patients who underwent osteochondroplasty, with or without labral repair. Study outcomes included patient-reported pain (using a 100-point Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)), hip function (using the Hip Outcome Score (HOS) and International Hip Outcome Tool (iHOT-12)), and health-related quality of life (using the EuroQol 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D)) measured at baseline, 2 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months post-operatively. There was a decrease in mean post-operative pain VAS scores from baseline. The first 2 weeks post-operative yielded the greatest reduction in pain with a mean (SD) VAS score of 37.8 (23.4), with score stabilization between 6 months (26.9 (26.9)) and 12 months (25.3 (27.6)). Mean HOS (activities of daily living) scores improved from baseline (59.7 (16.2)) starting at 6 weeks post-operative (64.1 (19.1)). The HOS (Sports) showed no improvement from baseline (41.2 (20.4)) until 3 months (49.1 (27.9)), and continued to improve at 6 months (64.1 (28.7)) and 12 months (68.6 (30.5)).
