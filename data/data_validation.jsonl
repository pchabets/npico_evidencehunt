Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) is a serious complication after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. There are no well-established treatment options for cGVHD after primary steroid-based treatment. Ibrutinib showed clinical benefit with an acceptable safety profile in steroid-dependent/refractory cGVHD patients in a Phase 1b/2 study (PCYC-1129-CA, NCT02195869), with which it was approved in the United States for adult cGVHD patients after failure of ≥1 systemic treatments. This open-label, single-arm, multicenter study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of ibrutinib in Japanese patients ≥12 years of age with steroid-dependent/refractory cGVHD (NCT03474679). Patients were assessed on the basis of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Consensus Development Project Criteria for Clinical Trials in cGVHD (2014). All patients received ibrutinib at a dose of 420 mg orally once daily, with a dose reduction to 280 mg/d on the concomitant use of voriconazole. Nineteen patients, including 1 adolescent, were enrolled and treated with ibrutinib in the study. At the time of clinical data cutoff (when the last patient completed the efficacy assessment at week 37), 10 of 19 patients (52.6%) remained on treatment whereas 9 of 19 patients (47.4%) had discontinued ibrutinib. The median duration of ibrutinib treatment was 9.63 (range 0.6 to 16.7+) months. The best overall response rate was 73.7%, and the rate of sustained response for ≥20 weeks was 71.4% for the responders (52.6% of all patients). Responses were seen across all the involved organs for cGVHD. Median daily corticosteroid dose requirement decreased by 0.06 mg/kg/d from baseline to week 36, whereas an improvement in the Lee cGVHD Symptom Scale score was observed in 42.1% of patients. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were pneumonia and stomatitis (36.8% each), upper respiratory tract infection (31.6%), cellulitis and platelet count decreased (26.3% each), and nausea (21.1%). Furthermore, 11 of 19 patients (57.9%) were reported with ≥1 treatment-emergent serious adverse events; the most common being pneumonia (26.3%) and cellulitis (15.8%). In total, 4 of 19 patients (21.1%) died during the study, of which 3 of 19 patients (15.8%) had TEAEs leading to death whereas 1 patient died of peritonitis, which occurred >30 days after the last dose of ibrutinib. Treatment-emergent adverse events leading to ibrutinib discontinuation were reported in 3 of 19 patients (15.8%). Ibrutinib was rapidly absorbed with a median time to reach maximum plasma concentration (tmax) of ~4.0 hours. Steady-state exposures were ~3.0- and ~1.4-fold higher for the patients receiving fluconazole (n = 8) and voriconazole (n = 4) with ibrutinib, respectively, as compared with patients not receiving CYP3A inhibitors (n = 7). Mean Bruton's tyrosine kinase occupancy was 88.1% at 4 hours after dose on day 1, and occupancy levels were maintained throughout the assessment period, regardless of the ibrutinib daily dose. Ibrutinib showed a clinically meaningful response and an acceptable safety profile in Japanese patients with steroid-dependent/refractory cGVHD; the safety profile was consistent with the known safety profile of ibrutinib in adults and with that seen in cGVHD patients receiving concomitant steroid treatment. Overall, the results were generally consistent with findings observed in the PCYC-1129-CA study.", "labels": [[61, 146, "Patient"], [787, 861, "Patient"], [1032, 1175, "Intervention"], [48, 57, "Intervention"], [428, 471, "Patient"], [575, 635, "Patient"], [714, 770, "Outcome"], [774, 783, "Intervention"], [3213, 3522, "B"]]}

Participants included 152 individuals aged 8 to 17 years with obsessive-compulsive disorder. Enrollment began in October 2017 and ended in May 2019. Follow-up ended in April 2020. Participants randomized to the stepped-care group (n = 74) received internet-delivered CBT for 16 weeks. Nonresponders at the 3-month follow-up were then offered a course of traditional face-to-face treatment. Participants randomized to the control group (n = 78) immediately received in-person CBT for 16 weeks. Nonresponders at the 3-month follow-up received additional face-to-face treatment. The primary outcome was the masked assessor-rated Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS) score at the 6-month follow-up. The scale includes 10 items rated from 0 (no symptoms) to 4 (extreme symptoms), yielding a total score range of 0 to 40, with higher scores indicating greater severity. Assessors were masked to treatment allocation at pretreatment, posttreatment, 3-month follow-up, and 6-month follow-up assessments. The predefined noninferiority margin was 4 points on the CY-BOCS. Among the 152 randomized participants (mean age, 13.4 years; 94 [62%] females), 151 (99%) completed the trial. At the 3-month follow-up, 34 participants (46%) in the stepped-care group and 23 (30%) in the in-person CBT group were nonresponders. At the 6-month follow-up, the CY-BOCS score was 11.57 points in the stepped-care group vs 10.57 points in the face-to-face treatment group, corresponding to an estimated mean difference of 0.91 points ([1-sided 97.5% CI, -∞ to 3.28]; P for noninferiority = .02).

There is no curative treatment. We undertook a nonrandomized, open-label, feasibility, and safety study using autologous keratinocytes transduced with a lentiviral vector encoding SPINK5 under the control of the human involucrin promoter. Six NS subjects were recruited, and gene-modified epithelial sheets were successfully generated in three of five subjects.

One subject was grafted with a 20 cm 2  gene-modified graft on the left anterior thigh without any adverse complications and was monitored by serial sampling for 12 months. Recovery within the graft area was compared against an area outside by morphology, proviral copy number and expression of the SPINK5 encoded protein, LEKTI, and its downstream target kallikrein 5, which exhibited transient functional correction. The study confirmed the feasibility of generating lentiviral gene-modified epidermal sheets for inherited skin diseases such as NS, but sustained LEKTI expression is likely to require the identification, targeting, and engraftment of long-lived keratinocyte stem cell populations for durable therapeutic effects.

An underlying cause of solid tumor resistance to chemotherapy treatment is diminished tumor blood supply, which leads to a hypoxic microenvironment, dependence on anaerobic energy metabolism, and impaired delivery of intravenous treatments. Preclinical data suggest that dietary strategies of caloric restriction and low-carbohydrate intake can inhibit glycolysis, while acute exercise can transiently enhance blood flow to the tumor and reduce hypoxia. The Diet Restriction and Exercise-induced Adaptations in Metastatic Breast Cancer (DREAM) study will compare the effects of a short-term, 50% calorie-restricted and ketogenic diet combined with aerobic exercise performed during intravenous chemotherapy treatment to usual care on changes in tumor burden, treatment side effects, and quality of life. Fifty patients with measurable metastases and primary breast cancer starting a new line of intravenous chemotherapy will be randomly assigned to usual care or the combined diet and exercise intervention. Participants assigned to the intervention group will be provided with food consisting of 50% of measured calorie needs with 80% of calories from fat and ≤ 10% from carbohydrates for 48-72 h prior to each chemotherapy treatment and will perform 30-60 min of moderate-intensity cycle ergometer exercise during each chemotherapy infusion, for up to six treatment cycles.

To investigate the association between admission plasma glucose and cardiovascular events in patients with acute myocardial infarction treated with modern therapies including early percutaneous coronary intervention and modern stents. Patients (n = 5309) with established diabetes and patients without previously known diabetes with a reported admission plasma glucose, included in the VALIDATE trial 2014-2016, were followed for cardiovascular events (first of mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure) within 180 days. Event rates were analysed by four glucose categories according to the World Health Organization criteria for hyperglycaemia and definition of diabetes. Odds ratios were calculated in a multivariate logistic regression model. Mean age was 67 ± 11 years. Previously known diabetes was present in 21.2% (n = 1124). Cardiovascular events occurred in 3.7%, 3.8%, 6.6% and 15.7% in the four glucose level groups and 9.9% in those with known diabetes (p < 0.001), while bleeding complications did not differ significantly (9.1%, 8.5%, 8.4%, 12.2% and 8.5%, respectively).

Gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) originates from placental tissue and exhibits the potential for invasion and metastasis. Gene alterations in GTN have not been extensively studied because of a lack of qualified tumor specimens after chemotherapy. GTN has a rapid growth rate and is highly metastatic, which makes circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) sequencing a promising modality for gene profiling. Accordingly, in this study, we performed targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) of 559 tumor-associated genes using circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) collected prior to chemotherapy from 11 patients with GTN. All sequenced genes were associated with oncogenesis, progression, and targeted therapy. The average cfDNA level was 0.43 ± 0.22 ng/μL.

Mobile teledermoscopy is a rapidly advancing technology that promotes early detection and management of skin cancers. Whilst the use of teledermoscopy has proven to be effective and has a role in the detection of skin cancers, patients' attitudes towards the multiple ways in which this technology can be utilised has not been explored. Data were obtained from a large randomised controlled trial comparing mobile teledermoscopy-enhanced skin self-examinations (SSEs) with naked-eye SSE. A semi-structured interview guide was developed by the investigators with questions focusing on people's previous skin screening behaviours and 2 of the major pathways which can be utilised in mobile teledermoscopy: (i) direct-to-consumer and (ii) doctor-to-doctor. All interviews were tape-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Thematic analysis was undertaken by 2 independent researchers. Twenty-eight participants were interviewed. Eighty-six percent of participants (n = 24/28) had previously had a clinical skin examination. Only 18% of participants (n = 5/28) visited the same doctor for each clinical skin examination. Five main themes were identified in the interviews that affected how people felt about the integration of mobile teledermoscopy into skin screening pathways: history of clinical skin examinations, continuity of the doctor-patient relationship, convenience of the direct-to-consumer teledermoscopy, expedited review enhancing the doctor-to-doctor setting and mobile teledermoscopy as a partner-assisted task. Overall mobile teledermoscopy was viewed positively for both direct-to-consumer and doctor-to-doctor interaction. Continuity of care in the doctor-patient relationship was not found to be a priority for clinical skin examination with most participants visiting several doctors throughout their clinical skin examination history.", "labels": [[1731, 1945, "B"], [585, 850, "Intervention"], [974, 999, "Patient"]]}

We had previously reported short-term efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety of the BNT162b2 vaccine among cancer patients with solid tumors. We aimed to evaluate these outcomes at six months postvaccination. The study cohort comprised patients who were on treatment during vaccination and throughout six months postvaccination. Serologic tests were performed after second vaccination and six months afterward. An age-matched cohort of health care workers served as controls. Documentation of COVID-19 infection, blood tests, and imaging studies during the study period was reviewed. Participants included 154 patients and 135 controls. Six months postvaccination, 122 (79%) patients were seropositive compared with 114 (84%) controls (P = 0.32). Serology titer dramatically decreased in a similar manner in both cohorts. No COVID-19 cases were documented in controls, and one case occurred in patient cohort. All previously reported adverse effects resolved. Taken together, the pattern of immunogenicity, efficacy, and safety of BNT162b2 in patients with cancer with solid tumors at six months postvaccination resembles that of the general population. SIGNIFICANCE: Evidence regarding efficacy and safety of COVID-19 vaccines in patients with cancer indicate a favorable short-term profile.

This study screened for clinical symptoms and evaluated the efficacy of a brief, online social-contact-based video intervention in increasing treatment-seeking intentions among veterans. We hypothesized that the video-based intervention would increase treatment-seeking intentions more than written vignette and control conditions. One hundred seventy-two veterans were randomized to either a (a) brief video-based intervention; (b) written vignette intervention, or (c) nonintervention control group. In the 3-min video, a veteran previously diagnosed with PTSD described his symptom reactivation by Covid-19, his barriers to care, and how therapy helped him to cope. Assessments were conducted at baseline, postintervention, and at 14- and 30-day follow-ups. A total of 91 (53%) veterans reported high levels of clinical symptoms, especially those self-reporting Covid-19 exposure. The brief video-based intervention yielded greater increase in treatment-seeking intentions among veterans. Within the video group, women showed an increase in treatment-seeking intentions from baseline to postintervention only, whereas men showed a more sustained effect, from baseline to Day 14. Surveyed veterans reported high symptoms levels. A brief video intervention increased treatment-seeking intention, likely through identification and emotional engagement with the video protagonist.

Eight patient groups were created based on the initial dose received in SAMURAI or SPARTAN and the subsequent dose in GLADIATOR: placebo-100, placebo-200, 50-100, 50-200, 100-100, 100-200, 200-100, 200-200. Migraine pain freedom, migraine-related functional disability freedom, most bothersome symptom (MBS) freedom, and pain relief were evaluated at 2-h post-dose. The occurrence of most common treatment-emergent adverse events (MC-TEAE) was evaluated. Shift analyses were performed for pain freedom and ≥1 MC-TEAE. The incidence of patients with a specific outcome from the first and subsequent doses were compared within each dose change group using McNemar's test.Results: Small, but consistent, increases in incidences of pain freedom, migraine-related functional disability freedom, MBS freedom, and pain relief occurred when the second lasmiditan dose was higher than the initial dose. For patients starting on 50 mg, increasing to 100 or 200 mg provided a positive efficacy-TEAE balance, despite an increase in incidence of ≥1 MC-TEAE. For patients starting on 100 mg, increasing to 200 mg provided a positive efficacy-TEAE balance. If the initial dose was 100 or 200 mg, the incidence of patients experiencing ≥1 MC-TEAE decreased or stayed the same with their subsequent dose, regardless of dose. Decreasing from 200 to 100 mg led to a decrease in patients with pain freedom and ≥1 MC-TEAE, resulting in a neutral efficacy-TEAE balance. Shift analyses supported these findings.Conclusion: A positive efficacy-TEAE balance exists for patients increasing their lasmiditan dose for treatment of a subsequent migraine attack.

Serrated polyposis syndrome (SPS), characterized by multiple and/or large proximal serrated lesions, increases the risk of colorectal cancer. Serrated lesions often are missed during colonoscopy but panchromoendoscopy can increase their detection in an average-risk population. We performed a randomized controlled study to determine the efficacy of panchromoendoscopy in detection of polyps in patients with SPS. Patients with SPS (n = 86 patients) underwent tandem high-definition (HD) colonoscopies from February 2015 through July 2016 at 7 centers in Spain. Patients were assigned randomly to groups that received 2 HD white-light endoscopy examinations (HD-WLE group; n = 43) or HD-WLE followed by 0.4% indigo carmine panchromoendoscopy (HD-CE group; n = 43). For each procedure, polyps detected were described, removed, and analyzed by histology. The primary outcome was additional polyp detection rate, defined as the number of polyps detected during the second inspection divided by the total number of polyps detected during the first and the second examination. A total of 774 polyps were detected (362 in the HD-WLE group and 412 in the HD-CE group); 54.2% were hyperplastic, 13.8% were adenomas, and 10.9% were sessile serrated polyps. There was a significantly higher additional polyp detection rate in the HD-CE group (0.39; 95% CI, 0.35-0.44) than in the HD-WLE group (0.22; 95% CI, 0.18-0.27) (P < .001). A higher additional rate of serrated lesions proximal to the sigmoid colon were detected in the second inspection with HD-CE (0.40; 95% CI, 0.33-0.47) than with HD-WLE (0.24; 95% CI, 0.19-0.31) (P = .001). Detection of adenomas and serrated lesions greater than 10 mm did not differ significantly between groups. In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, only use of HD-CE was associated independently with increased polyp detection throughout the colon.

The challenges posed by the spread of COVID-19 disease through aerosols have compelled anesthesiologists to modify their airway management practices. Devices such as barrier boxes are being considered as potential adjuncts to full PPE's to limit the aerosol spread. Usage of the barrier box raises concerns of delay in time to intubate (TTI). We designed our study to determine if using a barrier box with glidescope delays TTI within acceptable parameters to make relevant clinical conclusions. Seventy-eight patients were enrolled in this prospective non-inferiority controlled trial and were randomly allocated to either group C (without the barrier box) or the study group BB (using barrier box). The primary measured endpoint is time to intubate (TTI), which is defined as time taken from loss of twitches confirmed with a peripheral nerve stimulator to confirmation of end-tidal CO 2. 15 s was used as non-inferiority margin for the purpose of the study. We used an unpaired two-sample single-sided t-test to test our non- inferiority hypothesis (H 0: Mean TTI diff ≥15 s, H A: Mean TTI diff < 15 s). Secondary endpoints include the number of attempts at intubation, lowest oxygen saturation during induction, and the need for bag-mask ventilation. Mean TTI in group C was 42 s (CI 19.2 to 64.8) vs. 52.1 s (CI 26.1 to 78) in group BB. The difference in mean TTI was 10.1 s (CI -∞ to 14.9). We rejected the null hypothesis and concluded with 95% confidence that the difference of the mean TTI between the groups is less than < 15 s (95% CI -∞ to 14.9,p = 0.0461). Our induction times were comparable (67.7 vs. 65.9 s).100% of our patients were intubated on the first attempt in both groups. None of our patients needed rescue breaths.

The primary safety objective was to demonstrate that the algorithm did not result in pauses or heart rates of >100 beats/min. Overall, 75 patients from 12 centers were enrolled; an accelerometer-based algorithm was downloaded to their leadless pacemakers. Among the 40 patients with sinus rhythm and complete AV block included in the primary efficacy objective analysis, the proportion of patients with ≥70% AV synchrony at rest was significantly greater with VDD pacing than with VVI pacing (95% vs. 0%; p < 0.001).

However, whether wavefront progression of necrosis also occurs laterally has been disputed. We aimed to assess the transmural and lateral spread of myocardial damage after acute myocardial infarction in humans and to evaluate the impact of metoprolol on these.

Six months after STEMI, myocardial scarring (delayed gadolinium enhancement) was significantly less extensive in the transmural and lateral dimensions, suggesting that infarct resorption occurs in both. Furthermore, progression in both directions occurred both in patients receiving metoprolol and control patients, implying that myocardial salvage occurs both in the transmural and the lateral direction.

Background: Communication disorders are a common public health problem affecting up to 20% of children. Evidence points to the importance of early detection and intervention to improve young children's communicative abilities and decrease developmental delay. Early identification of communication difficulties is possible with instruments such as Infant-Toddler Checklist. The ComAlong Toddler intervention is tailored to the needs of parents of young children with communication delay before definitive diagnosis. The parents are provided with guidance in communication enhancing strategies during home visit and five group sessions. Methods: The study uses a prospective cohort design. Children were consecutively recruited during 2015-2017, and data will be collected 2015-2023. The screening was performed at the child health centre through use of the Infant-Toddler Checklist. An assessment and first consultation were then performed by a speech and language therapist for children with suspected communication delay according to the screen as well as for children referred for other reasons before the age of 2.5 years. Children with confirmed communication delay were randomised between two interventions: the ComAlong Toddler parental course or a telephone follow-up. Outcome measures include child communication and language skills and use of augmentative and alternative communication.

Catheter-related bladder discomfort (CRBD) is postoperative distress caused by a urinary catheter. CRBD is related to muscarinic receptor activation. Chlorpheniramine has antimuscarinic properties. Hence, this investigation was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of chlorpheniramine in preventing CRBD in patients undergoing transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT). Seventy-six patients scheduled for TURBT under general anesthesia were assigned into two groups. In the chlorpheniramine group (n = 38), 100 ml normal saline containing 0.1 mg/kg chlorpheniramine was infused after general anesthesia induction. In the control group (n = 38), 100 ml normal saline alone was infused. The incidence and severity of CRBD were assessed at 1, 6, and 24 h postoperatively. The 1-h postoperative incidence of CRBD was lower in the chlorpheniramine group based on the unadjusted analysis [16 (42%) vs. 28 (74%), risk difference 32%, 95% confidence interval 8-51, p = 0.005].

The authors' primary hypothesis was that pain relief would be better with a nerve block. Secondarily, they hypothesized that analgesic use, survival, and quality of life might be affected. This randomized, double-blind, parallel-armed trial was conducted in five Chinese centers. Eligible patients suffering from moderate to severe pain conditions were randomly assigned to receive splanchnic nerve block with either absolute alcohol (neurolysis) or normal saline (control). The primary outcome was pain relief measured on a visual analogue scale. Opioid consumption, survival, quality of life, and adverse effects were also documented. Analgesics were managed using a protocol common to all centers. Patients were followed up for 8 months or until death. Ninety-six patients (48 for each group) were included in the analysis.

The primary endpoint was non-inferiority of the cycle 7 pertuzumab serum trough concentration (Ctrough; ie, cycle 8 predose pertuzumab concentration) within the fixed-dose combination for subcutaneous injection versus intravenous pertuzumab plus trastuzumab in the per-protocol pharmacokinetic population (all enrolled patients who adhered to prespecified criteria for pharmacokinetic assessment). Non-inferiority was concluded if the lower bound of the 90% CI of the geometric mean ratio was 0·8 or higher. The safety population included all patients who received at least one dose of study medication, including chemotherapy or HER2-targeted therapy. Enrolment, neoadjuvant therapy, and surgery have been completed; adjuvant treatment and follow-up are ongoing. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03493854. Between June 14, 2018, and Dec 24, 2018, 252 patients were randomly assigned to the intravenous infusion group and 248 to the fixed-dose combination group. The geometric mean ratio of pertuzumab serum Ctrough subcutaneous to serum Ctrough intravenous was 1·22 (90% CI 1·14-1·31). The most common grade 3-4 adverse events occurring during neoadjuvant treatment with HER2-targeted therapy plus chemotherapy in 5% or more of patients were neutropenia (34 [13%] of 252 patients in the intravenous infusion group vs 35 [14%] of 248 patients in the fixed-dose combination group), decreased neutrophil count (31 [12%] vs 27 [11%]), febrile neutropenia (14 [6%] vs 16 [6%]), diarrhoea (12 [5%] vs 17 [7%]), and decreased white blood cell count (18 [7%] vs nine [4%]). At least one treatment-related serious adverse event was reported in 25 (10%) patients in the intravenous infusion group and 26 (10%) patients in the fixed-dose combination group. One patient in each treatment group had an adverse event that led to death (urosepsis in the intravenous infusion group and acute myocardial infarction in the fixed-dose combination group); neither death was related to HER2-targeted therapy. The study met its primary endpoint: the fixed-dose combination of pertuzumab and trastuzumab for subcutaneous injection provides non-inferior cycle 7 pertuzumab serum Ctrough concentrations to intravenous pertuzumab plus trastuzumab in the neoadjuvant setting with comparable total pathological complete response rates, supporting the FDA approval.

To prevent medical sequelae of severe hypoglycemic emergencies, prompt and reliable rescue intervention is critically important. A ready-to-use, liquid stable glucagon, administered subcutaneously by glucagon autoinjector (GAI), Gvoke HypoPen (glucagon injection; Xeris Pharmaceuticals), was evaluated for rescue treatment of severe hypoglycemia. Two phase III, randomized, controlled, blinded, non-inferiority crossover studies were conducted in 161 adults with type 1 diabetes to compare 1 mg doses of GAI versus glucagon emergency kit (GEK) for treating insulin-induced severe hypoglycemia. Efficacy was evaluated as either a return of plasma glucose to >70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) or increase ≥20 mg/dL (1.1 mmol/L) from a baseline glucose of <50 mg/dL (2.9 mmol/L), within 30 min of dosing. For successful plasma glucose recovery within 30 min, treatment with GAI was non-inferior to GEK. Treatment with GAI was non-inferior to GEK for a plasma glucose >70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) or neuroglycopenic symptom relief within 30 min. From administration of glucagon, the mean time to achieve plasma glucose >70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) or increase ≥20 mg/dL (1.1 mmol/L) was 13.8±5.6 min for GAI and 10.0±3.6 min for GEK.

Mixed model regression was used to identify risk factors for postinjury firearm weapon carriage and PTSD symptoms. Firearm injury patients were younger and more likely to be black, male and of lower socioeconomic status, and more likely to carry a firearm in the year before injury. Relative to preinjury, there was a significant drop in firearm weapon carriage at 3- and 6-months postinjury, followed by a return to preinjury levels at 12-months. Firearm injury was significantly and independently associated with an increased risk of postinjury firearm weapon carriage [relative risk = 2.08, 95% confidence interval (1.34, 3.22), P < 0.01] and higher PTSD symptom levels [Beta = 3.82, 95% confidence interval (1.29, 6.35), P < 0.01].

Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, characterised by maternal pruritus and increased serum bile acid concentrations, is associated with increased rates of stillbirth, preterm birth, and neonatal unit admission. Ursodeoxycholic acid is widely used as a treatment without an adequate evidence base. We aimed to evaluate whether ursodeoxycholic acid reduces adverse perinatal outcomes in women with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy. We did a double-blind, multicentre, randomised placebo-controlled trial at 33 hospital maternity units in England and Wales. We recruited women with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, who were aged 18 years or older and with a gestational age between 20 weeks and 40 weeks and 6 days, with a singleton or twin pregnancy and no known lethal fetal anomaly. Participants were randomly assigned 1:1 to ursodeoxycholic acid or placebo, given as two oral tablets a day at an equivalent dose of 500 mg twice a day. The dose could be increased or decreased at the clinician's discretion, to a maximum of four tablets and a minimum of one tablet a day. We recommended that treatment should be continued from enrolment until the infant's birth. The primary outcome was a composite of perinatal death (in-utero fetal death after randomisation or known neonatal death up to 7 days after birth), preterm delivery (<37 weeks' gestation), or neonatal unit admission for at least 4 h (from birth until hospital discharge). Each infant was counted once within this composite. All analyses were done according to the intention-to-treat principle.

This study analyzed patient-therapist in-session interpersonal complementarity effects on the therapeutic alliance and depression severity during the initial and working phase of cognitive-behavioral therapy for depression. It also explored whether patients' interpersonal problems moderate those complementarity effects. We drew on a sample of 90 dyads derived from a randomized controlled trial of two cognitive-behavioral therapies for depression. Using an observer-based measure, we assessed patients' and therapists' interpersonal behavior in Sessions 1, 5, 9, and 13 and computed their complementarity regarding interpersonal affiliation (i.e., correspondence) and dominance (i.e., reciprocity). Patients completed measures of interpersonal problems at baseline and session-by-session measures of depression severity and quality of the therapeutic alliance. Response surface analyses based on polynomial regressions showed that patient-therapist complementarity in higher affiliative behaviors was associated with a stronger alliance. Interpersonal problems regarding agency moderated the complementarity effects of the dominance dimensions on depression severity. Overly dominant patients benefited more from a nonreciprocal relationship in the dominance dimension, whereas submissive patients benefited more from complementarity in that dimension. Furthermore, interpersonal problems of communion significantly moderated the effects of complementarity in affiliative behaviors on both the alliance and outcome. These results suggest the relevance of both interpersonal correspondence and reciprocity for the psychotherapy process, informing clinical practice in terms of interpersonal responsiveness. The moderation effects of interpersonal problems provide preliminary evidence, which should be replicated in future research, to determine relevant markers indicating for whom a complementary approach would be beneficial in cognitive therapy for depression.

Psoriatic plaques on one side of the body were treated with the 650-microsecond laser and plaques on the other side were treated with the 308-nm excimer laser. Subjects made up to 15 visits, twice weekly, or fewer if full clearance was achieved. Efficacy and tolerance were evaluated by the mPASI scores and local skin reactions, respectively.Results: Both devices showed efficacy in treating psoriatic plaques. Differences between the two devices were not significant for redness, thickness, scaliness, mPASI scores for arms and legs, and overall mPASI scores for the treated psoriatic plaques on each side of the body. The investigator-assessed scores for erosion/ulceration, vesicles, erythema, scaling, edema, and atrophy were low and identical for both sides of the body.Conclusion: The efficacy and tolerance of the 650-microsecond laser is equivalent to that of the excimer laser for the treatment of mild to moderate psoriasis vulgaris of the arms and legs.J Drugs Dermatol. 2020;19(2)176-183. doi:10.36849/JDD.2020.4769", "labels": [[54, 76, "Outcome"], [82, 116, "Intervention"], [122, 142, "Control"], [164, 199, "Patient"], [333, 352, "Outcome"], [360, 401, "Intervention"], [411, 424, "Control"], [446, 502, "Patient"], [614, 699, "Intervention"], [704, 772, "Control"], [774, 858, "Intervention"], [860, 956, "Outcome"], [1402, 1579, "B"]]}

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is highly curable with antiviral therapy, and traditionally, treatment adherence has been critical for treatment success. We sought to determine whether assessing HCV treatment readiness with a structured treatment readiness tool was associated with increased rates of adherence and cure among patients at a safety-net HCV clinic. We administered the Psychosocial Readiness Evaluation and Preparation for HCV Treatment (PREP-C) tool to 50 patients and compared them with 50 patients who received the usual care. The outcome measures included achievement of treatment milestones (eg, adherence to treatment, clinic visit attendance) and sustained virologic response (cure). We found no association between receiving the PREP-C assessment and outcomes, including referral to or starting HCV treatment, adherence to treatment, and HCV cure. We found that receiving the PREP-C assessment did not improve treatment outcomes, suggesting that targeted pretreatment assessment is unnecessary even in a medically and psychosocially complex population.", "labels": [[316, 392, "Intervention"], [423, 450, "Outcome"], [457, 492, "Patient"], [514, 595, "Intervention"], [663, 673, "Control"], [705, 834, "Outcome"], [1001, 1205, "B"]]}

The addition of lapatinib (L) to trastuzumab (T) was previously found to be synergistic in preclinical models and in the neoadjuvant setting. Prior to the results of the ALTTO trial, this study assessed the safety and feasibility of adding L to the standard adjuvant docetaxel, carboplatin, and trastuzumab (TCH) regimen in early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer (HER2+ BC). In this single-arm, 2-stage, phase II study, patients with stages I-III HER2+ BC received TCH plus L at 1000 mg daily for a total of 12 months. The primary endpoint was the safety and tolerability, including the rate of diarrhea. Secondary endpoints included adverse event (AE) profile using the NCI CTCAE v3.0 and cardiac safety.

An increasing number of clinical trials are studying immunotherapy for the treatment of brain metastases. The role of local therapy in this setting has not been well described. Twenty-three melanoma patients with brain metastases were treated with pembrolizumab in a prospective phase 2 trial, NCT02085070, and included in this secondary analysis. Patients had at least 1 untreated or progressive brain metastasis, 5 to 20 mm in size, without any associated neurologic symptoms. Local therapy (stereotactic radiosurgery, surgery, or laser interstitial thermal therapy) was used to treat concerning lesions immediately before trial enrollment and was also allowed on trial in patients whose brain metastases were progressing, but who were otherwise deriving benefit. In total, 13 out of 23 patients (57%) received local therapy immediately before or during the trial-4 patients received local therapy before the trial owing to lesion size or location in sensitive areas; 6 during the trial because of tumor growth, hemorrhage, or radiation necrosis/cystic changes; and 3 both before and during the trial. Of the 10 patients who did not receive local therapy immediately before or during the trial, 8 patients (35%) did not later receive local therapy owing to rapid disease progression, and only 2 patients (9%) lived for 2 years without requiring any local therapy. Local therapy continues to play an important role in the management of melanoma patients with brain metastases being treated with immunotherapy.

Retrospective study of 97 surgeries, deep sclerectomy (DE) or phaco-deep sclerectomy (PHACO-DS), were performed in patients with open angle glaucoma (OAG) comparing our modified underbleb subtenonian anesthesia (USA) (n=58) versus a control group under peribulbar anesthesia (PA) (n=38). Main outcomes were intraocular pressure (IOP), number of antiglaucomatous drugs and total and qualificated success, compared during 1, 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months follow up after glaucoma surgery. Both groups were comparable in terms of age, gender, surgical technique, number of antiglaucoma drugs and preoperative IOP. The IOP in the USA group decreased as in PA control group without statistical significant differences except at 24 months, where the IOP was 2mm lower (14.83 ± 2.87 vs. 17.61 ± 4.27 (P=.009).

Serratus anterior plane block (SAPB) and intercostal nerve block (ICNB) are attractive options for multimodal analgesia in patients undergoing thoracoscopic surgery, but which block is superior remains unclear. The present study aimed to assess the effect of SAPB versus ICNB on reducing postoperative pain after video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) for lobectomy. This prospective, randomized, active-intervention-controlled, subject-assessor-blinded, single-center, parallel-group trial allocated 18- to 80-year-old patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists status I to III to receive either SAPB or ICNB in a 1:1 ratio. The primary outcome was numerical pain rating scale (NRS) scores during the first 24 hours postoperatively. The secondary outcomes were postoperative cumulative doses of ketorolac and fentanyl, and the occurrence of postoperative adverse effects. Among the 57 patients assessed for eligibility, 50 were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio. Due to conversion to open thoracotomy and patient-controlled analgesia pump failure, 4 patients were excluded and 46 were analyzed. The intergroup differences in NRS scores were not statistically significant at any time point. Cumulative consumptions of fentanyl and ketorolac were also not significantly different. No perioperative adverse events occurred. Postoperative complications were also absent, except for nausea (2/23 patients [8.7% in both groups]).
