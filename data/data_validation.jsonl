Behavioral interventions for pediatric insomnia are cost-effective and benefit most families, but there is no evidence indicating which treatments are most suitable for specific patient populations. This randomized controlled trial evaluated the moderating role of infant separation anxiety in two brief interventions for infant sleep problems. Ninety-one infants aged 9-18 months (61% boys) with pediatric insomnia were randomized to either Checking-in, a Graduated extinction protocol which involves gradual separation from parents, or to the Camping-out intervention, in which parental presence is maintained. Sleep was measured using actigraphy and parent reports. Infant separation anxiety was observed in the laboratory. Assessments were completed at baseline, post-treatment and 6-month follow-up. Improvement in sleep was demonstrated following both interventions and maintained at follow-up. Separation anxiety did not change significantly following treatment. Infant separation anxiety moderated treatment efficacy, with greater benefit for infants with high separation anxiety in the Camping-out compared to the Checking-in intervention. This study provides support for considering infant separation anxiety in the effort to personalize treatment for pediatric insomnia. Pediatricians should incorporate evaluation of infant separation anxiety to assessment processes, and favor more gentle treatment approaches, such as Camping-out, over Graduated extinction for highly anxious infants.

The WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11th, 2020. This serious outbreak and the precipitously increasing numbers of deaths worldwide necessitated the urgent need to develop an effective severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine. The development of COVID-19 vaccines has moved quickly. In this study, we assessed the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of an inactivated (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety of an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and its lot-to-lot consistency. A total of 1620 healthy adults aged 18-59 years were randomly assigned to receive 2 injections of the trial vaccine or placebo on a day 0 and 14 schedule. This article was based on an interim report completed within 3 months following the last dose of study vaccine. The interim analysis includes safety and immunogenicity data for 540 participants in the immunogenicity subset and an efficacy analysis of the 1620 subjects. For the safety evaluation, solicited and unsolicited adverse events were collected after the first and second vaccination within 14 and 28 days, respectively. Blood samples were collected for an antibody assay before and 14 days following the second dose. Most of the adverse reactions were in the solicited category and were mild in severity. Pain at the injection site was the most frequently reported symptom. Antibody IgG titer determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was 97.48% for the seroconversion rate. Using a neutralization assay, the seroconversion rate was 87.15%.

BACKGROUND : Bleeding after endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is a severe adverse event. Several methods to prevent post-ESD bleeding (PEB) have been introduced; however, they have not been widely used because of technical difficulties. We aimed to investigate whether polysaccharide hemostatic powder (PHP), which is very easy to apply, can prevent early post-ESD bleeding, especially in patients with a high risk of post-ESD bleeding. METHODS : This was a prospective, multicenter, randomized, open-label, controlled trial. Patients with a high risk for post-ESD bleeding were enrolled. Patients with gastric neoplasms in whom the resected specimen size was expected to be > 40 mm and those who were regularly taking antithrombotic agents were defined as high risk patients. Patients were randomly assigned to the PHP or control groups. RESULTS:  Between May 2017 and September 2018, 143 patients were enrolled (PHP group, 73; control group, 70). The total post-ESD bleeding rate was 6.3 % (PHP group, 5.5 % vs. control group, 7.1 %; P = 0.74). There was no bleeding within 7 days after ESD in the PHP group. Continued antithrombotic use was an independent risk factor for post-ESD bleeding. In subgroup analysis excluding the patients who continued to take antithrombotic agents (n = 129) during ESD, the rate of post-ESD bleeding tended to be lower in the PHP group than in the control group (0 % vs. 6.3 %; P = 0.06). CONCLUSION : PHP did not demonstrate a significant effect on the prevention of post-ESD bleeding in this study.

Worldwide, there are only few studies focusing on labor analgesia on the MLAC (minimum local analgesic concentration) or EC50 (median effective concentration) of sufentanil and ropivacaine. Therefore, we determine the MLAC or EC50 of sufentanil and ropivacaine for epidural analgesia by using an up-down sequential allocation and survey its adverse effect in a prospective blinded randomized trial. Sixty nulliparous full-term parturients who required labor analgesia were recruited and randomly divided into the sufentanil and ropivacaine groups. The formulation was 25 μg sufentanil combined with 0.1% ropivacaine (added 0.9% normal saline to 75 ml). According to the response of a previous parturient, the dosage of sufentanil was increased or decreased by 5 μg in the sufetanil group; meanwhile, we also administrated an initial concentration of 0.1% ropivacaine combined with 22.5 μg sufentanil (added 0.9% normal saline to 75 ml) in the ropivacaine group. The concentration of ropivacaine was increased or decreased by 0.01% following the response of the previous parturient. The Brownlee up-down sequential allocation was used to estimate the MLAC of epidural ropivacaine and its 95% confidence intervals in labor analgesia.

Gefitinib and erlotinib are efficacious and safe for older patients with epidermal growth factor receptor-mutant non-small cell lung cancer. However, prolonged use of epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors in older patients is difficult, owing to potential adverse events. Hence, dose reduction or treatment discontinuation is often required. We investigated the efficacy of low-dose first-line erlotinib and its effects on the quality of life of older patients with lung cancer. A prospective, multicenter, phase II clinical trial was carried out in patients aged ≥75 years with epidermal growth factor receptor-mutant non-small cell lung cancer. Initially, 100 mg/day erlotinib was administered orally; if well tolerated, it was increased to 150 mg/day. The primary end-point was progression-free survival, and secondary end-points were the response rate, overall survival and change in quality of life (Care Notebook questionnaire). The median progression-free survival was 17.8 months, response rate was 63.6% and median overall survival was 27.8 months. The change in the quality of life after 6 weeks was assessed in 72.7% of the patients. Fatigue, pain, anxiety and deterioration in daily activities were found in at least 40% of the patients. Despite the therapeutic effect of 100 mg/day erlotinib, many patients required dose reduction, and in some, the quality of life could not be maintained. Many older patients with epidermal growth factor receptor-mutant non-small cell lung cancer might require treatment dose reduction.

The initial study concluded that a 6-month home-based mobile CR programme was safe and beneficial in improving VO2peak when compared with no CR. To assess whether a 6-month guided mobile CR programme is a cost-effective therapy for elderly patients who decline participation in CR. Patients were enrolled in a multicentre randomised clinical trial from November 11, 2015, to January 3, 2018, and follow-up was completed on January 17, 2019, in a secondary care system with 6 cardiac institutions across 5 European countries. A total of 179 patients who declined participation in centre-based CR and met the inclusion criteria consented to participate in the European Study on Effectiveness and Sustainability of Current Cardiac Rehabilitation Programs in the Elderly trial. The data of patients (n = 17) that were lost in follow-up were excluded from this analysis. The intervention (n = 79) consisted of 6 months of mobile CR programme with telemonitoring, and coaching based on motivational interviewing to stimulate patients to reach exercise goals. Control patients did not receive any form of CR throughout the study period. The costs considered for the cost-effectiveness analysis of the RCT are direct costs 1) of the mobile CR programme, and 2) of the care utilisation recorded during the observation time from randomisation to the end of the study. Costs and outcomes (utilities) were compared by calculation of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. The healthcare utilisation costs (P = 0.802) were not significantly different between the two groups. However, the total costs were significantly higher in the intervention group (P = 0.040). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for the primary endpoint VO2peak at 6 months was €1085 per 1-unit [ml/kg/min] improvement in change VO2peak and at 12 months it was €1103 per 1 unit [ml/kg/min] improvement in change VO2peak. Big differences in the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for the primary endpoint VO2peak at 6 months and 12 months were present between the adherent participants and the non-adherent participants.

There is currently a significant unmet need for disease-modifying therapy that regresses LVH in HCM patients. Perhexiline, a potent carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1 (CPT-1) inhibitor, improves myocardial energetics in HCM, and has the potential to reduce LVH in HCM. The primary objective is to evaluate the effects of perhexiline treatment on the extent of LVH, in symptomatic HCM patients with at least moderate LVH. RESOLVE-HCM is a prospective, multicenter double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trial enrolling symptomatic HCM patients with at least moderate LVH. Sixty patients will be randomized to receive either perhexiline or matching placebo. The primary endpoint is change in LVH, assessed utilizing cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging, after 12-months treatment with perhexiline. RESOLVE-HCM will provide novel information on the utility of perhexiline in regression of LVH in symptomatic HCM patients. A positive result would lead to the design of a Phase 3 clinical trial addressing long-term effects of perhexiline on risk of heart failure and mortality in HCM patients.", "labels": [[92, 145, "Patient"], [767, 778, "Intervention"], [792, 809, "Outcome"], [814, 865, "Patient"], [968, 1019, "Patient"], [1088, 1104, "Control"], [1130, 1255, "Outcome"], [31, 42, "Intervention"], [46, 88, "Outcome"], [922, 940, "Control"], [1073, 1084, "Intervention"], [1380, 1550, "O"]]}

Hospitalized acutely ill medical patients are at risk for fatal and major thromboembolic events. Whether use of extended-duration primary thromboprophylaxis can prevent such events is unknown. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether extended-duration rivaroxaban reduces the risk of venous and arterial fatal and major thromboembolic events without significantly increasing major bleeding in acutely ill medical patients after discharge. MARINER (A Study of Rivaroxaban [JNJ-39039039] on the Venous Thromboembolic Risk in Post-Hospital Discharge Patients) studied acutely ill medical patients with additional risk factors for venous thromboembolism (VTE). Medically ill patients with a baseline creatinine clearance ≥50 ml/min were randomized in a double-blind fashion to rivaroxaban 10 mg or placebo daily at hospital discharge for 45 days. Exploratory efficacy analyses were performed with the intent-to-treat population including all data through day 45. Time-to-event curves were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. A blinded independent committee adjudicated all clinical events. In total, 4,909 patients were assigned to rivaroxaban and 4,913 patients to placebo. The mean age was 67.8 years, 55.5% were men, mean baseline creatinine clearance was 87.8 ml/min, and mean duration of hospitalization was 6.7 days. The pre-specified composite efficacy endpoint (symptomatic VTE, myocardial infarction, nonhemorrhagic stroke, and cardiovascular death) occurred in 1.28% and 1.77% of patients in the rivaroxaban and placebo groups, respectively (hazard ratio: 0.72; 95% confidence interval: 0.52 to 1.00; p = 0.049), whereas major bleeding occurred in 0.27% and 0.18% of patients in the rivaroxaban and placebo groups, respectively (hazard ratio: 1.44; 95% confidence interval: 0.62 to 3.37; p = 0.398).

S44819, a selective GABAA α5 receptor antagonist, reduces tonic post-ischaemic inhibition of the peri-infarct cortex. S44819 improved stroke recovery in rodents and increased cortical excitability in a transcranial magnetic stimulation study in healthy volunteers. The Randomized Efficacy and Safety Trial of Oral GABAA α5 antagonist S44819 after Recent ischemic Event (RESTORE BRAIN) aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of S44819 for enhancing clinical recovery of patients with ischaemic stroke. RESTORE BRAIN was an international, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, multicentre phase 2 trial that evaluated the safety and efficacy of oral S44189 in patients with recent ischaemic stroke. The study was done in specialised stroke units in 92 actively recruiting centres in 14 countries: ten were European countries (Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Spain, and the UK) and four were non-European countries (Australia, Brazil, Canada, and South Korea). Patients aged 18-85 years with acute ischaemic stroke involving cerebral cortex (National Institute of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS] score 7-20) without previous disability were eligible for inclusion. Participants were randomly assigned to receive 150 mg S44819 twice a day, 300 mg S44819 twice a day, or placebo twice a day by a balanced, non-adaptive randomisation method with a 1:1:1 ratio. Treatment randomisation and allocation were centralised via the interactive web response system using computer-generated random sequences with a block size of 3. Blinding of treatment was achieved by identical appearance and taste of all sachets. Patients, investigators and individuals involved in the analysis of the trial were masked to group assignment. The primary endpoint was the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score 90 days from onset of treatment, evaluated by shift analysis (predefined main analysis) or by dichotomised analyses using 0-1 versus 2-6 and 0-2 versus 3-6 cutoffs (predefined secondary analysis). Secondary endpoints were the effects of S44819 on the NIHSS and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores, time needed to complete parts A and B of the Trail Making Test, and the Barthel index. Efficacy analyses were done on all patients who received at least one dose of treatment and had at least one mRS score taken after day 5 (specifically, on or after day 30). Safety was compared across treatment groups for all patients who received at least one dose of treatment. The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02877615.

Background and aims: Despite promising results, only a few studies have been published on serum calprotectin as a biomarker in IBD. Recently, plasma measurements of calprotectin have been shown to be more reliable than serum measurements. In this study, we aim to assess plasma and serum calprotectin measurements as biomarkers of disease activity in paediatric and adult ulcerative colitis.Methods: Paediatric (5-18 years) and adult (>18 years) patients scheduled for colonoscopy due to suspected or confirmed ulcerative colitis were included prospectively. Stool and blood samples were collected at time of colonoscopy and patient symptom scores were recorded. At colonoscopy the Ulcerative Colitis Endoscopic Index of Severity was recorded. Histology was graded according to the Geboes score.Results: 84 patients where included; 30 paediatric and 54 adult patients. Plasma calprotectin had a stronger correlation to all outcome variables than serum calprotectin. Plasma calprotectin correlated positively to disease extent (Rho = 0.53, p < .0001), symptoms scores (Rho = 0.54, p = .002, only in the paediatric cohort), endoscopic scores (Rho = 0.39, p = .0003), histological scores (Rho 0.28, p = .01) and, when using endoscopic assessment of severity as reference, could discriminate active disease from patients in remission (p = .03).Conclusions: While more studies are needed to assess if plasma calprotectin can discriminate healthy individuals from ulcerative colitis, this study indicates that plasma calprotectin can be used as a biomarker of disease activity, especially in cases where faecal calprotectin measurements are cumbersome either due to patient compliance or logistical requirements.", "labels": [[99, 117, "Patient"], [59, 95, "Outcome"], [0, 19, "Intervention"], [35, 53, "Control"], [436, 466, "Outcome"], [470, 509, "Patient"], [519, 648, "Patient"], [1472, 1825, "O"], [678, 861, "Outcome"]]}

Evidence shows that low-level laser therapy (LLLT) may shorten the recovery time of healing wounds. This study sought to assess the effect of LLLT on the recovery time of neurosensory deficits after Le Fort I osteotomy and bilateral sagittal split osteotomy using the blink reflex. This randomized double-blind clinical trial evaluated 12 patients undergoing orthognathic surgery of the maxilla/mandible. One random quadrant of the maxilla/mandible underwent 810 nm gallium-aluminum-arsenide laser (infrared spectrum, 200 mW, 12 J/cm 2 , 60-second irradiation time of each point, continuous-wave mode), while the laser handpiece was used in off mode for the other quadrant, postoperatively. The patients underwent LLLT at 1, 5, 10, and 14 days, postoperatively. The blink test was performed to assess the function of the trigeminal nerve, and the 2-point discrimination (TPD) test was performed to assess the recovery of the inferior alveolar nerve (IAN) and the infraorbital nerves at 30 and 90 days, postoperatively. Data were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test (alpha = 0.05). Six women and 6 men were evaluated (mean age = 23.41 ± 5.03 years). Both groups showed significant improvement in function of the IAN and infraorbital nerves, postoperatively in blink reflex test (P < .05). In the TPD test, although both groups showed significant improvement of the IAN compared with the baseline (P < .05), the IAN showed significantly greater improvement by 1.1% in the laser group (P = .036). The percentage of change was significantly smaller in the laser group in R1 (by 14%; P = .025) and R2C wavelengths of the IAN and in the TPD test of the IAN (by 20%; P = .021), showing significantly greater improvement in laser group.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 may cause low oxygen saturation (SpO2) and respiratory failure in patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Hence, increased SpO2 levels in COVID-19 patients could be crucial for their quality of life and recovery. This study aimed to demonstrate that a 30-minute single session of dorsal low-field thoracic magnetic stimulation (LF-ThMS) can be employed to increase SpO2 levels in COVID-19 patients significantly. Furthermore, we hypothesized that the variables associated with LF-ThMS, such as frequency, magnetic flux density, and temperature in the dorsal thorax, might be correlated to SpO2 levels in these patients.Here we employed an LF-ThMS device to noninvasively deliver a pulsed magnetic field from 100 to 118 Hz and 10.5 to 13.1 milliTesla (i.e., 105 to 131 Gauss) to the dorsal thorax. These values are within the intensity range of several pulsed electromagnetic field devices employed in physical therapy worldwide. We designed a single-blind, sham-controlled, crossover study on 5 COVID-19 patients who underwent 2 sessions of the study (real and sham LF-ThMS) and 12 patients who underwent only the real LF-ThMS.We found a statistically significant positive correlation between magnetic flux density, frequency, or temperature, associated with the real LF-ThMS and SpO2 levels in all COVID-19 patients. However, the 5 patients in the sham-controlled study did not exhibit a significant change in their SpO2 levels during sham stimulation.

Supra-total glioblastoma resection has gained growing attention with regard to superior long-term disease control.

Against this backdrop we analyzed our institutional database with regard to potential survival benefits of anterior temporal lobectomy as a paradigm for supra-total resection in patients with precisely temporal-located, non-eloquent glioblastoma. Between 2012 and 2017, 38 patients with isolated temporal glioblastoma underwent GTR or temporal lobectomy at the authors' institution. Both groups of differing resection modalities were compared with regard to postoperative Karnofsky performance score (KPS), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Patients with temporal lobectomy exhibited significantly superior median KPS at the 12 months follow-up compared to the GTR group (median KPS of 80 vs. 60, p = 0.04).

We sought to characterize longitudinal PROs and cosmesis in a randomized trial comparing conventionally fractionated (CF) versus hypofractionated (HF) WBI. From 2011 to 2014, women aged ≥40 years with Tis-T2 N0-N1a M0 breast cancer who underwent a lumpectomy with negative margins were randomized to CF-WBI (50 Gray [Gy]/25 fractions plus boost) versus HF-WBI (42.56 Gy/16 fractions plus boost).

Multivariable mixed-effects growth curve models evaluated associations of the treatment arm and patient factors with outcomes and tested for relevant interactions with the treatment arm. A total of 287 patients were randomized, completing a total of 14,801 PRO assessments.

We analyzed clinical and neuroimaging data from a randomized controlled rehabilitation trial. Participants completed clinical assessments and neuroimaging at baseline and clinical assessments 4 months later, postintervention. Using univariate linear regression analysis, we determined the linear relationship between the DTI-derived CST fractional anisotropy asymmetry (FAasym) and the percentage of baseline change in log-transformed average Wolf Motor Function Test time for distal items (ΔlnWMFT-distal_%). The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) linear regressions with cross-validation and bootstrapping were used to determine the relative weighting of CST FAasym, other brain metrics, clinical outcomes, and demographics on distal motor improvement. Logistic regression analyses were performed to test whether the CST FAasym can predict clinically significant UE motor improvement. lnWMFT-distal significantly improved at the group level. Baseline CST FAasym explained 26% of the variance in ΔlnWMFT-distal_%.

Eligibility criteria for participants were: female gender, 18-25 years of age, no dermatological treatment within the last 12 months and mild to moderate papulopustular acne. We treated 120 young women (with a mean age of 22 years old) with six peeling sessions at 2-week intervals. In the parallel clinical study design, one randomized group (n = 60, 50%) was treated using azelaic acid (AA), whereas the second group participated in pyruvic acid (PA) sessions. We evaluated the patients clinically twice (before and after treatment), using the Scale of Hellegren-Vincent Severity Symptoms to assess the acne diagnosis, and the Nati Analyzer to estimate the skin properties (oily skin, desquamation, porosity, and moisture). The clinical evaluation of the patients demonstrated a significant reduction of acne severity symptoms in both the AA and PA groups, after the peeling sessions. An effect was also found in terms of decreasing desquamation and the oiliness of the skin. PA showed a more significant reduction of greasy skin than AA. In conclusion, after the six peeling sessions using AA and PA, all patients showed better skin parameters in term of reduced oiliness and desquamation.

In this analysis of the Phase 3b JUMP study, which included patients aged ≥18 years with a diagnosis of primary or secondary myelofibrosis, we assessed the safety and efficacy of ruxolitinib in patients stratified by Dynamic International Prognostic Scoring System (DIPSS) risk categories. Baseline characteristic data were available to assess DIPSS status for 1844 of the 2233 enrolled patients; 60, 835, 755, and 194 in the low-, intermediate (Int)-1-, Int-2-, and high-risk groups, respectively. Ruxolitinib was generally well tolerated across all risk groups, with an adverse-event (AE) profile consistent with previous reports. The most common hematologic AEs were thrombocytopenia and anemia, with highest rates of Grade ≥3 events in high-risk patients.

This study aimed to evaluate whether vitamin D deficiency is associated with the severity of symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients. Stress and gut inflammation can increase the serum level of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), leading to a change in bowel movements. The aim of this study was to evaluate the anti-inflammatory and psychological effects of vitamin D3 supplementation on the symptom improvement of patients with a diarrhea-predominant form of IBS (IBS-D). Eighty-eight IBS-D patients (age: 18-65 years) based on Rome IV criteria who suffered from vitamin D deficiency and/or insufficiency were enrolled in this randomized, placebo-controlled trial from February 2017 to May 2018 at Rasoul-e-Akram Hospital, Tehran, Iran. Participants were randomly divided into two groups. The intervention group received 50,000 IU vitamin D3 weekly and the control group received a placebo for 9 weeks. All patients received Mebeverine 135 mg twice a day besides supplementation. The IBS Severity Score System (IBS-SSS), serum 25(OH) vitamin D3, CRH, and IL-6 were measured before and after interventions. Seventy-four patients completed the study. The severity of IBS symptoms (p < 0.01) and IL-6 (p = 0.02) decreased significantly in the intervention group as compared to the control group, but there was no significant difference in the serum level of CRH. Also, in the treatment group, IBS-SSS and IL-6 were significantly reduced at the end of the study from baseline (p < 0.01 and p < 0.03, respectively). Our findings indicate that vitamin D3 supplementation can modulate the serum level of CRH and IL-6 and can improve symptoms in IBS-D patients. Vitamin D3 supplementation should be considered in IBS-D patients who suffer from vitamin D deficiency and/or insufficiency. Ziele: Diese Studie untersucht den Zusammenhang zwischen Vitamin-D-Mangel und dem Schweregrad der Symptome von Patienten mit Reizdarmsyndrom (irritable bowel syndrome, IBS). Stress und Darmentzündung können erhöhte Serumkonzentrationen von Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone (CRH) und Interleukin-6 (IL-6) zur Folge haben, die zu Veränderungen des Stuhlverhaltens führen.

Methoden: In diese randomisierte, placebokontrollierte Studie, die von Februar 2017 bis Mai 2018 am Rasoul-e-Akram Hospital in Teheran, Iran, durchgeführt wurde, wurden 88 Patienten mit IBS-D gemäß den Rom-IV-Kriterien (Alter: 18–65 Jahre) aufgenommen. Die Studienteilnehmer wurden randomisiert einer von zwei Gruppen zugeordnet. Die Interventionsgruppe erhielt wöchentlich über 9 Wochen 50’000 IU Vitamin D3, und die Kontrollgruppe erhielt ein Placebo. Alle Patienten erhielten neben der Supplementierung zweimal täglich Mebeverin 135 mg. Vor und nach der Intervention erfolgten eine Beurteilung der Krankheitsschwere gemäß IBS Severity Score System (IBS-SSS) sowie eine Bestimmung der Serumkonzentrationen von 25(OH)-Vitamin D3, CRH und IL-6. Ergebnisse: Vierundsiebzig Teilnehmer schlossen die Studienteilnahme ab.

This European, phase 3, randomized, open-label, active-controlled study investigated efficacy and safety of roxadustat in patients with end-stage kidney disease on dialysis for at least 4 months. Patients were randomized to switch from an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) (epoetin alfa or darbepoetin alfa) to roxadustat three times/week or to continue their previous ESA. Roxadustat and ESA doses were adjusted to maintain hemoglobin within 10.0-12.0 g/dL during the treatment period (day 1 up to 52-104 weeks). Primary endpoints were hemoglobin change from baseline (CFB) to the average of weeks 28-36 without rescue therapy and hemoglobin CFB to the average of weeks 28-52 regardless of rescue therapy. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were assessed descriptively. Of 1081 screened patients, 836 were randomized and received treatment (roxadustat, n = 415; ESA, n = 421).

Background and objectives: The fixed-rate continuous background infusion mode with bolus dosing is a common modality for intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (PCA). However, some patients suffer from inadequate analgesia or opioid-related adverse effects due to the biphasic pattern of postoperative pain. Therefore, we investigated the postoperative analgesic efficacy of PCA using an optimizing background infusion mode (OBIM) where the background injection rate varies depending on the patient's bolus demand. Materials and Methods: We prospectively enrolled 204 patients who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy in a randomized, controlled, double-blind study. Patients were allocated to either the optimizing (group OBIM) or the traditional background infusion group (group TBIM). The numeric rating scale (NRS) score for pain was evaluated at admission to and discharge from the recovery room, as well as at the 6th, 24th, and 48th postoperative hours. Data on bolus demand count, total infused volume, and background infusion rate were downloaded from the PCA device at 30-min intervals until the 48th postoperative hour. Results: The NRS score was not significantly different between groups throughout the postoperative period (p = 0.621), decreasing with time in both groups (p < 0.001). The bolus demand count was not significantly different between groups throughout (p = 0.756). The mean total cumulative infused PCA volume was lower in group OBIM (84.0 (95% confidence interval: 78.9-89.1) mL) than in group TBIM (102 (97.8-106.0) mL; p < 0.001). The total cumulative opioid dose in fentanyl equivalents, after converting sufentanil to fentanyl using an equipotential dose ratio, was lower in group OBIM (714.1 (647.4-780.9) μg) than in group TBIM (963.7 (870.5-1056.9) μg); p < 0.001). The background infusion rate was significantly different between groups throughout the study period (p < 0.001); it was higher in group OBIM than in group TBIM before the 12th postoperative hour and lower from the 18th to the 48th postoperative hour. Conclusions: The OBIM combined with bolus dosing reduces the cumulative PCA volume and opioid consumption compared to the TBIM combined with bolus dosing, while yielding comparable postoperative analgesia and bolus demand in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy.", "labels": [[167, 215, "Patient"], [617, 649, "Outcome"], [653, 791, "Intervention"], [842, 897, "Patient"], [985, 1008, "Intervention"], [1068, 1409, "Outcome"], [1016, 1066, "Control"], [2333, 2607, "O"]]}

Cell salvage has recently been recommended for obstetric use in cases with a high risk of massive hemorrhage during cesarean section (CS). However, limited data are available to support the use of one suction device to collect lost blood. This study aimed to investigate the volume of red blood cells (RBCs) salvaged and the components of amniotic fluid (AF) in blood salvaged by one suction device or two devices during CS in patients with placenta previa and/or accrete. Thirty patients with placenta previa and/or accrete undergoing elective CS in the Women's Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine were recruited for the present study from November 1, 2017 to December 1, 2018. The patients were randomly assigned to one of the two groups according to an Excel-generated random number sheet: Group 1 (n = 15), in which only one suction device was used to aspirate all blood and AF, and Group 2 (n = 15), in which a second suction device was mainly used to aspirate AF before the delivery of the placenta. Three samples of blood per patient (pre-wash, post-wash, and post-filtration) were collected to measure AF components. The salvaged RBC volumes were recorded. Continuous data of pre-wash, post-wash, and post-filtration samples were analyzed by using one-way analysis of variance with Tukey's test for multiple comparisons, or Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn test for multiple comparisons. Comparisons of continuous data between Group 1 and Group 2 were conducted using Student's t test or Mann-Whitney U test. The salvaged RBC volume was significantly higher in Group 1 than that in Group 2 (401.6 ± 77.2 mL vs. 330.1 ± 53.3 mL, t = 4.175, P < 0.001). In both groups, squamous cells, lamellar bodies, and fat were significantly reduced by washing (all P<0.001) and squamous cells were further reduced by filtering (P < 0.001). Squamous cells were found in six post-filtration samples (three from each group). Lamellar bodies and fat were completely removed by filtering. Insulin-like growth factor binding protein 1, alpha-fetoprotein, albumin, lactate dehydrogenase, and potassium were significantly reduced post-wash (all P < 0.05), with no further significant reduction after filtration in either group (all P > 0.05).

We conducted a study to test the effects of increased serum bicarbonate level on muscle parameters, nutrition, and renal function in pre-dialysis CKD patients. This was a randomized, controlled study. CKD stage 3-4 patients with serum HCO3- <22 mEq/L were randomized to either receive oral sodium bicarbonate with high target bicarbonate level of 25 ± 1 or standard level of 22 ± 1 mEq/L as control group using protocol-based titration of dosage adjustment. The changes of muscle mass measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), muscle strength by hand grip dynamometer, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) using CKD-Epidemiology Collaboration equation, nutritional markers, and muscle-related biomarkers were determined. Data at baseline and after 4 months of sodium bicarbonate supplementation were compared between groups using Student t test or chi-square test as appropriate. Forty-two patients completed the study (n = 21 per group). The mean age and eGFR were 61.2 ± 9.8 years and 32.4 ± 14.1 mL/min respectively. Serum bicarbonate levels at baseline were 21.0 ± 2.1 mEq/L. Baseline data including sex, diabetes, serum bicarbonate level, creatinine, and blood pressure were similar.

Among 47 patients who provided whole blood starting material for manufacturing the product, 15 patients received a median of 4 doses of baltaleucel T. Thirty-two (68%) patients did not receive baltaleucel-T due to manufacturing failure, rapid disease progression, and death.

Depression is associated with major patient burden. Its treatment requires complex and collaborative approaches. A stepped care model based on the German National Clinical Practice Guideline Unipolar Depression has been shown to be effective. In this study we assess the cost-effectiveness of this guideline based stepped care model versus treatment as usual in depression. This prospective cluster-randomized controlled trial included 737 depressive adult patients. Primary care practices were randomized to an intervention (IG) or a control group (CG). The intervention consisted of a four-level stepped care model. The CG received treatment as usual. A cost-utility analysis from the societal perspective with a time horizon of 12 months was performed. We used quality-adjusted life years (QALY) based on the EQ-5D-3L as effect measure. Resource utilization was assessed by patient questionnaires. Missing values were imputed by 'multiple imputation using chained equations' based on predictive mean matching. We calculated adjusted group differences in costs and effects as well as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. To describe the statistical and decision uncertainty cost-effectiveness acceptability curves were constructed based on net-benefit regressions with bootstrapped standard errors (1000 replications). The complete sample and subgroups based on depression severity were considered. We found no statically significant differences in costs and effects between IG and CG. The incremental total societal costs (+€5016; 95%-CI: [-€259;€10,290) and effects (+ 0.008 QALY; 95%-CI: [- 0.030; 0.046]) were higher in the IG in comparison to the CG. Significantly higher costs were found in the IG for outpatient physician services and psychiatrist services in comparison to the CG. Significantly higher total costs and productivity losses in the IG in comparison to the CG were found in the group with severe depression. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for the IG in comparison to the CG were unfavourable (complete sample: €627.000/QALY gained; mild depression: dominated; moderately severe depression: €645.154/QALY gained; severe depression: €2082,714/QALY gained) and the probability of cost-effectiveness of the intervention was low, except for the group with moderate depression (ICER: dominance; 70% for willingness-to-pay threshold of €50,000/QALY gained).

Telework has been widely discussed in several fields; however, there is a lack of research on the health aspects of teleworking. The current study was conducted to determine the health effects of teleworking during an emergency statement as evidence for future policy development. This was a cross-sectional study in which we administered an online questionnaire to 5,214 general workers (response rate = 36.4%) from June 2020 to August 2020. Based on working methods during the pandemic, workers were categorized into the office group (n = 86) and telework group (n = 1597), and we characterized their demographics, changes in lifestyle, telework status, physical symptoms, and mental health. The results showed that the workers' residence, marital status, management positions, and employee status affected the choice of the work method. During the emergency, teleworkers experienced more changes in their habits than office workers. In terms of exercise habits, 67.0% of the individuals belonging to the office-telework (OT) group exercised less. Approximately half of the teleworkers were satisfied with their telework, and those in the OT group were less satisfied with their telework than those in the telework-telework (TT) group, and they reported an increase in both working hours and meeting hours.

{"id": 98, "text": "SCORE Operational Research on Moving toward Interruption of Schistosomiasis Transmission. As part of its diverse portfolio, the Schistosomiasis Consortium for Operational Research and Evaluation (SCORE) included two cluster-randomized trials evaluating interventions that could potentially lead to interruption of schistosomiasis transmission (elimination) in areas of Africa with low prevalence and intensity of infection. These studies, conducted in Zanzibar and Côte d'Ivoire, demonstrated that multiyear mass drug administration (MDA) with praziquantel failed to interrupt the transmission of urogenital schistosomiasis, even when provided biannually and/or supplemented by small-scale implementation of additional interventions. Other SCORE activities related to elimination included a feasibility and acceptability assessment of test-treat-track-test-treat (T5) strategies and mathematical modeling. Future evaluations of interventions to eliminate schistosomiasis should recognize the difficulties inherent in conducting randomized controlled trials on elimination and in measuring small changes where baseline prevalence is low. Highly sensitive and specific diagnostic tests for use in very low-prevalence areas for schistosomiasis are not routinely available, which complicates accurate measurement of infection rates and assessment of changes resulting from interventions in these settings. Although not encountered in these two studies, as prevalence and intensity decrease, political and community commitment to population-wide MDA may decrease. Because of this potential problem, SCORE developed and funded the T5 strategy implemented in Egypt, Kenya, and Tanzania. It is likely that focal MDA campaigns, along with more targeted approaches, including a T5 strategy and snail control, will need to be supplemented with the provision of clean water and sanitation and behavior change communications to achieve interruption of schistosome transmission.", "labels": [[1680, 1964, "O"], [44, 88, "Outcome"], [360, 422, "Patient"], [298, 356, "Outcome"]]}

Melanoma therapy has changed dramatically over the last decade with improvements in immunotherapy, yet many patients do not respond to current therapies. This novel vaccine strategy may prime a patient's immune system against their tumor and work synergistically with immunotherapy against advanced-stage melanoma. This was a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase IIb trial of the tumor lysate, particle-loaded, dendritic cell (TLPLDC) vaccine administered to prevent recurrence in patients with resected stage III/IV melanoma. Patients were enrolled and randomized 2:1 to the TLPLDC vaccine or placebo (empty yeast cell wall particles and autologous dendritic cells). Both intention-to-treat (ITT) and per treatment (PT) analyses were predefined, with PT analysis including patients who remained disease-free through the primary vaccine/placebo series (6 months). A total of 144 patients were randomized (103 vaccine, 41 control). Therapy was well-tolerated with similar toxicity between treatment arms; one patient in each group experienced related serious adverse events. While disease-free survival (DFS) was not different between groups in ITT analysis, in PT analysis the vaccine group showed improved 24-month DFS (62.9% vs. 34.8%, p = 0.041). This phase IIb trial of TLPLDC vaccine administered to patients with resected stage III/IV melanoma shows TLPLDC is well-tolerated and improves DFS in patients who complete the primary vaccine series.

{"id": 307, "text": "Hypoxia dynamics on FMISO-PET in combination with PD-1/PD-L1 expression has an impact on the clinical outcome of patients with Head-and-neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma undergoing Chemoradiation. Tumor-associated hypoxia influences the radiation response of head-and-neck cancer (HNSCC) patients, and a lack of early hypoxia resolution during treatment considerably deteriorates outcomes. As the detrimental effects of hypoxia are partly related to the induction of an immunosuppressive microenvironment, we investigated the interaction between tumor hypoxia dynamics and the PD-1/PD-L1 axis in HNSCC patients undergoing chemoradiation and its relevance for patient outcomes in a prospective trial. Methods: 49 patients treated with definitive chemoradiation for locally advanced HNSCC were enrolled in this trial and received longitudinal hypoxia PET imaging using fluorine-18 misonidazole ([ 18 F]FMISO) at weeks 0, 2 and 5 during treatment. Pre-therapeutic tumor biopsies were immunohistochemically analyzed regarding the PD-1/PD-L1 expression both on immune cells and on tumor cells, and potential correlations between the PD-1/PD-L1 axis and tumor hypoxia dynamics during chemoradiation were assessed using Spearman's rank correlations. Hypoxia dynamics during treatment were quantified by subtracting the standardized uptake value (SUV) index at baseline from the SUV values at weeks 2 or 5, whereby SUV index was defined as ratio of maximum tumor [ 18 F]FMISO SUV to mean SUV in the contralateral sternocleidomastoid muscle (i.e. tumor-to-muscle ratio). The impact of the PD-1/PD-L1 expression alone and in combination with persistent tumor hypoxia on locoregional control (LRC), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) was examined using log-rank tests and Cox proportional hazards models. Results: Neither PD-L1 nor PD-1 expression levels on tumor-infiltrating immune cells influenced LRC (HR = 0.734; p = 0.480 for PD-L1, HR = 0.991; p = 0.989 for PD-1), PFS (HR = 0.813; p = 0.597 for PD-L1, HR = 0.796; p = 0.713 for PD-1) or OS (HR = 0.698; p = 0.405 for PD-L1, HR = 0.315; p = 0.265 for PD-1). However, patients with no hypoxia resolution between weeks 0 and 2 and PD-L1 expression on tumor cells, quantified by a tumor proportional score (TPS) of at least 1%, showed significantly worse LRC (HR = 3.374, p = 0.022) and a trend towards reduced PFS (HR = 2.752, p = 0.052). In the multivariate Cox regression analysis, the combination of absent tumor hypoxia resolution and high tumoral PD-L1 expression remained a significant prognosticator for impaired LRC (HR = 3.374, p = 0.022). On the other side, tumoral PD-L1 expression did not compromise the outcomes of patients whose tumor-associated hypoxia declined between week 0 and 2 during chemoradiation (LRC: HR = 1.186, p = 0.772, PFS: HR = 0.846, p = 0.766). Conclusion: In this exploratory analysis, we showed for the first time that patients with both persistent tumor-associated hypoxia during treatment and PD-L1 expression on tumor cells exhibited a worse outcome, while the tumor cells' PD-L1 expression did not influence the outcomes of patients with early tumor hypoxia resolution.
