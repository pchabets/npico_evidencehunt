{"id": 183, "text": "Effects of Exercise Training during Christmas on Body Weight and Cardiometabolic Health in Overweight Individuals. : Individuals with abdominal obesity and metabolic syndrome (MetS) have augmented risk of all-cause mortality. Lifestyle interventions are effective to treat MetS, however, there are periods during the year in which exercise programs are discontinued and improper dietary habits reappear (e.g., Christmas holidays). We aimed to analyze if exercise-training during Christmas holidays would avoid body-weight gains and cardiometabolic deterioration in MetS individuals, using a randomized control trial. Thirty-eight men with MetS undergoing exercise training were randomly allocated to either continue (TRAIN group, n = 16) or discontinue (HOLID group, n = 22) training, during the three weeks of Christmas. Anthropometrics (body weight, fat, and waist circumference), fasting blood metabolites (glucose, insulin, triglycerides, and cholesterol concentrations) and exercise maximal fat oxidation (FOMAX) and oxygen uptake (VO2PEAK) were determined before and after Christmas. Both groups were similar at baseline in all parameters (p > 0.05). HOLID group increased body weight (91.3 ± 13.0 to 92.0 ± 13.4 kg, p = 0.004), mean arterial pressure (94.0 ± 10.6 to 97.1 ± 8.9 mmHg, p = 0.026), blood insulin (10.2 ± 3.8 to 12.5 ± 5.4 µIU·mL -1 , p = 0.003) and HOMA (3.2 ± 1.3 to 4.1 ± 2.3, p = 0.003). In contrast, TRAIN prevented those disarrangements and reduced total (170.6 ± 30.6 to 161.3 ± 31.3 mg·dL -1 , p = 0.026) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (i.e., LDL-C, 104.8 ± 26.1 to 95.6 ± 21.7 mg·dL -1 , p = 0.013). TRAIN also prevented the reductions in exercise FOMAX and VO2PEAK that was observed in the HOLID group (p = 0.002). In conclusion, exercise training during Christmas, prevents body weight gains and the associated cardiovascular (increase in blood pressure and LDL-C) and metabolic (reduced insulin sensitivity) health risks are an optimal non-pharmacological therapy for that period of the year.", "labels": [[11, 45, "Intervention"], [49, 87, "Outcome"], [91, 113, "Patient"], [454, 497, "Intervention"], [510, 561, "Outcome"], [565, 581, "Patient"], [617, 672, "Patient"], [707, 715, "Intervention"], [741, 752, "Control"], [822, 1088, "Outcome"], [1754, 2033, "TOREMOVE"]]}

BI 695501 is a biosimilar that has demonstrated similar efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity to adalimumab reference product in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and chronic plaque psoriasis. The VOLTAIRE-CD study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of BI 695501 with adalimumab reference product in patients with Crohn's disease. This phase 3, randomised, double-blind study was done at 92 centres in 12 countries across Europe and the USA in patients aged 18-80 years with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease (Crohn's Disease Activity Index [CDAI] score 220-450). Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 using an interactive response technology system to the BI 695501 group or adalimumab reference product group, stratified by previous exposure to infliximab (yes vs no) and simple endoscopic score for Crohn's disease at screening (<16 vs ≥16). All investigators involved in trial assessments or procedures and all patients were masked to treatment allocation until week 24. Patients received BI 695501 (40 mg/0·8 mL formulation) or adalimumab reference product (either 40 mg/0·4 mL citrate-free or 40 mg/0·8 mL) 160 mg on day 1 and 80 mg on day 15, followed by 40 mg every 2 weeks, via subcutaneous injection. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with clinical response (CDAI decrease ≥70 points) at week 4, with an exploratory non-inferiority margin of 0·76 for the lower limit of the two-sided 90% CI of the risk ratio (RR). The primary analysis was done in a modified full analysis set of all patients who received at least one dose of study medication and had a baseline and at least one post-baseline CDAI assessment. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study medication. After week 4, responders were treated until week 46; those randomly assigned to adalimumab reference product switched to BI 695501 at week 24.

In the safety analysis set, 45 (63%) of 72 patients in the BI 695501 group and 42 (56%) of 75 in the adalimumab reference product group had an adverse event during weeks 0-24; 31 (43%) and 34 (45%) had adverse events during weeks 24-56. The most common drug-related treatment-emergent adverse events during weeks 0-24 were weight increase (three [4%] patients in the BI 695501 group) and injection-site erythema and upper respiratory tract infection (three [4%] patients for each event) in the adalimumab reference product group. The only drug-related TEAEs reported in two or more patients during weeks 24-56 were weight increase and increased γ-glutamyltransferase, which occured in two (3%) patients each in the BI 695501 group. No drug-related TEAEs were reported in two or more patients during weeks 24-56 in the adalimumab reference product followed by BI 699501 group. Serious adverse events occurred in six (8%) patients in the BI 695501 group and eight (11%) in the adalimumab reference group between weeks 0-24, and two (3%) and nine (12%) patients between weeks 24-56. Adverse events of special interest occurred in two (3%) patients in each treatment group during weeks 0-24 (acute sinusitis and pulmonary tuberculosis in the BI 695501 group and anal abscess and postoperative wound infection in the adalimumab reference product group) and two (3%) patients in each group during weeks 24-56 (psoas abscess and hypersensitivity in the BI 695501 group and pulmonary tuberculosis and erythematous rash in the adalimumab reference product followed by BI 699501 group).

The intent-to-treat (ITT) population, while on treatment without rescue medication, was used for all efficacy analyses; the ITT population without rescue medication was used for hypoglycaemia analyses; all other safety analyses used the ITT population. Patients aged 65 years or older and those younger than 65 years had a mean age of 69.5 and 53.2 years, respectively. In each age subgroup, the reduction from baseline in HbA1c and body weight (BW), and the proportion of patients achieving a composite endpoint of HbA1c of less than 7% (<53 mmol/mol) with no weight gain and no documented symptomatic or severe hypoglycaemia, were larger for dulaglutide 3.0 and 4.5 mg compared with dulaglutide 1.5 mg, but the treatment-by-age interactions were not significant. The safety profile for the additional dulaglutide doses was consistent with that of dulaglutide 1.5 mg and was similar between the age subgroups. Dulaglutide doses of 3.0 or 4.5 mg provided clinically relevant, dose-related improvements in HbA1c and BW with no significant treatment-by-age interactions, and with a similar safety profile across age subgroups.", "labels": [[53, 104, "Patient"], [0, 19, "Outcome"], [23, 49, "Intervention"], [163, 182, "Outcome"], [186, 212, "Intervention"], [220, 226, "Control"], [232, 262, "Intervention"], [320, 328, "Patient"], [1345, 1558, "TOREMOVE"]]}

Cell salvage has recently been recommended for obstetric use in cases with a high risk of massive hemorrhage during cesarean section (CS). However, limited data are available to support the use of one suction device to collect lost blood. This study aimed to investigate the volume of red blood cells (RBCs) salvaged and the components of amniotic fluid (AF) in blood salvaged by one suction device or two devices during CS in patients with placenta previa and/or accrete. Thirty patients with placenta previa and/or accrete undergoing elective CS in the Women's Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine were recruited for the present study from November 1, 2017 to December 1, 2018. The patients were randomly assigned to one of the two groups according to an Excel-generated random number sheet: Group 1 (n = 15), in which only one suction device was used to aspirate all blood and AF, and Group 2 (n = 15), in which a second suction device was mainly used to aspirate AF before the delivery of the placenta. Three samples of blood per patient (pre-wash, post-wash, and post-filtration) were collected to measure AF components. The salvaged RBC volumes were recorded. Continuous data of pre-wash, post-wash, and post-filtration samples were analyzed by using one-way analysis of variance with Tukey's test for multiple comparisons, or Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn test for multiple comparisons. Comparisons of continuous data between Group 1 and Group 2 were conducted using Student's t test or Mann-Whitney U test. The salvaged RBC volume was significantly higher in Group 1 than that in Group 2 (401.6 ± 77.2 mL vs. 330.1 ± 53.3 mL, t = 4.175, P < 0.001). In both groups, squamous cells, lamellar bodies, and fat were significantly reduced by washing (all P<0.001) and squamous cells were further reduced by filtering (P < 0.001). Squamous cells were found in six post-filtration samples (three from each group). Lamellar bodies and fat were completely removed by filtering. Insulin-like growth factor binding protein 1, alpha-fetoprotein, albumin, lactate dehydrogenase, and potassium were significantly reduced post-wash (all P < 0.05), with no further significant reduction after filtration in either group (all P > 0.05).

To this end, we revisited a prior study of intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) for PTSD, to evaluate whether mild AUD impacted safety and clinical outcomes. Fifty veterans with PTSD (n=17, with comorbid AUD) received 10 days of sham-controlled iTBS, followed by 10 unblinded sessions. Stimulation was delivered at 80% of the motor threshold for 1800 pulses to the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Safety, PTSD and depressive outcomes were evaluated with repeated measures analysis of variance, to examine the effects of time, treatment group and comorbid AUD. iTBS was safe, although AUD patients reported more adverse events, regardless of whether they received active or sham stimulation. Regarding clinical outcomes, patients with AUD who received active stimulation demonstrated a greater rate of improvement in depression symptoms than those without comorbid AUD. The presence of AUD did not impact PTSD symptom change. Limitations include a modest sample size and use of a categorical, rather than continuous, index of AUD diagnosis.

Twelve participants were recruited to this randomized crossover trial. Following a 4-week run-in period, participants received a mixed meal on three occasions with the same carbohydrate content but different macronutrient composition: high protein-high fat with alcohol (0.7g/kg body weight, beer), high protein-high fat without alcohol, and low protein-low fat without alcohol at 2-week intervals. Plasma and interstitial glucose, insulin, glucagon, growth hormone, cortisol, alcohol, free fatty acids, lactate, and pH concentrations were measured during 6 hours. A statistical analysis was then carried out to determine significant differences between studies. Significantly higher late postprandial glucose was observed in studies with higher content of fats and proteins (p=0.0088). This was associated with lower time in hypoglycemia as compared with the low protein and fat study (p=0.0179), at least partially due to greater glucagon concentration in the same period (p=0.04). Alcohol significantly increased lactate, decreased pH and growth hormone, and maintained free fatty acids suppressed during the late postprandial phase (p<0.001), without significant changes in plasma glucose.

This study reports on the performance of a leadless ventricular pacemaker with automated, enhanced accelerometer-based algorithms that provide atrioventricular (AV) synchronous pacing. Despite many advantages, leadless pacemakers are currently only capable of single-chamber ventricular pacing. The prospective MARVEL 2 (Micra Atrial tRacking using a Ventricular accELerometer 2) study assessed the performance of an automated, enhanced accelerometer-based algorithm downloaded to the Micra leadless pacemaker for up to 5 h in patients with AV block. The primary efficacy objective was to demonstrate the superiority of the algorithm to provide AV synchronous (VDD) pacing versus VVI-50 pacing in patients with sinus rhythm and complete AV block. The primary safety objective was to demonstrate that the algorithm did not result in pauses or heart rates of >100 beats/min. Overall, 75 patients from 12 centers were enrolled; an accelerometer-based algorithm was downloaded to their leadless pacemakers. Among the 40 patients with sinus rhythm and complete AV block included in the primary efficacy objective analysis, the proportion of patients with ≥70% AV synchrony at rest was significantly greater with VDD pacing than with VVI pacing (95% vs. 0%; p < 0.001). The mean percentage of AV synchrony increased from 26.8% (median: 26.9%) during VVI pacing to 89.2% (median: 94.3%) during VDD pacing. There were no pauses or episodes of oversensing-induced tachycardia reported during VDD pacing in all 75 patients.

We evaluated a culturally sensitive expressive writing intervention, which combined cognitive reappraisal and emotional disclosure, in reducing PTSD among Chinese American BCSs. We also tested social constraints (defined as social conditions when individuals feel misunderstood or alienated when they desire to disclose their thoughts and feelings) as a moderator. Chinese American BCSs (n = 136) were randomly assigned to three groups with assigned writing topics for 3 weeks: a self-regulation group, which wrote about the deepest feelings related to cancer in week 1, cognitive reappraisal about stress and coping in week 2, and benefit finding in week 3; an enhanced self-regulation group, with the same instructions, except weeks 1 and 2 were reversed; and a cancer-fact group, which wrote about cancer experiences objectively for 3 weeks. PTSD symptoms were measured at baseline and 1-, 3-, and 6-month follow-ups. Social constraints were measured at baseline.

Older patients received a higher number of co-medications and received the 2.5 mg apixaban dose more often as compared to younger patients (22% vs. < 1%). Linear regression demonstrated that the unadjusted slope for apixaban concentration effect on anti-Factor Xa activity was similar across each age quantile. Although, the overall adjusted linear regression analysis demonstrated that the age by concentration interaction was statistically significant, relative differences in anti-Factor Xa activity (< 8%) were not clinically meaningful. Data on apixaban concentrations and anti-Factor Xa activity from a pivotal randomized double-blind study of apixaban for the prevention of stroke in NVAF patients have confirmed that the chromogenic anti-Factor Xa activity assay can accurately assess apixaban concentrations in patients regardless of age. Age was not associated with a clinically relevant change in the apixaban vs. anti-Factor Xa activity response relationship and target ranges are unchanged.", "labels": [[402, 455, "Patient"], [315, 318, "Intervention"], [326, 398, "Outcome"], [555, 617, "Patient"], [676, 768, "Outcome"], [1774, 1929, "TOREMOVE"]]}
{"id": 265, "text": "The inhibitory effect of word neighborhood size when reading with central field loss is modulated by word predictability and reading proficiency. For normally sighted readers, word neighborhood size (i.e., the total number of words that can be formed from a single word by changing only one letter) has a facilitator effect on word recognition. When reading with central field loss (CFL) however, individual letters may not be correctly identified, leading to possible misidentifications and a reverse neighborhood size effect. Here we investigate this inhibitory effect of word neighborhood size on reading performance and whether it is modulated by word predictability and reading proficiency. Nineteen patients with binocular CFL from 32 to 89 years old (mean ± SD = 75 ± 15) read short sentences presented with the self-paced reading paradigm. Accuracy and reading time were measured for each target word read, along with its predictability, i.e., its probability of occurrence following the two preceding words in the sentence using a trigram analysis. Linear mixed effects models were then fit to estimate the individual contributions of word neighborhood size, predictability, frequency and length on accuracy and reading time, while taking patients' reading proficiency into account. For the less proficient readers, who have given up daily reading as a consequence of their visual impairment, we found that the effect of neighborhood size was reversed compared to normally sighted readers and of higher amplitude than the effect of frequency. Furthermore, this inhibitory effect is of greater amplitude (up to 50% decrease in reading speed) when a word is not easily predictable because its chances to occur after the two preceding words in a specific sentence are rather low. Severely impaired patients with CFL often quit reading on a daily basis because this task becomes simply too exhausting. Based on our results, we envision lexical text simplification as a new alternative to promote effective rehabilitation in these patients. By increasing reading accessibility for those who struggle the most, text simplification might be used as an efficient rehabilitation tool and daily reading assistive technology, fostering overall reading ability and fluency through increased practice.", "labels": [[574, 596, "Intervention"], [600, 619, "Outcome"], [705, 756, "Patient"], [3, 21, "Outcome"], [25, 47, "Intervention"], [848, 1056, "Outcome"], [2045, 2297, "TOREMOVE"], [553, 570, "Outcome"]]}

Takotsubo Syndrome(TTS), contrary to historical reports, is now increasingly recognised to be associated with substantial mortality and morbidity, both in the short- and long-term. Although TTS is often precipitated by a catecholamine pulse, in-hospital hypotension is a common occurrence, increasing the risk of mortality. Furthermore, despite the transient catecholamine stimulus, there is increasing evidence that there are significant long term sequelae, including persistently impaired left ventricular(LV) systolic dysfunction, myocardial oedema with fibrosis, as well as persistent impairment of quality of life. A definitive therapeutic option to limit the extent of initial myocardial injury, and to accelerate recovery in TTS is therefore justified. However to date, there has been a lack of prospective studies in this area. NACRAM is a multi-centre, randomised, placebo-controlled trial, sequentially testing early use of intravenous N-acetylcysteine(NAC), followed by/or oral ramipril for 12 weeks. The rationale for utilising these agents is related to their effects on limiting nitrosative stress and expression of the inflammasome activator thioredoxin interacting protein(TXNIP); both processes fundamental to the pathogenesis of TTS. NACRAM is assessing resolution of myocardial oedema on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging(CMR), improvements in LV systolic function as measured by global longitudinal strain(GLS) on echocardiography, quality of life, and inflammatory markers.

The role of cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is well established in the secondary prevention of ischemic heart disease. Unfortunately, the participation rates across Europe remain low, especially in elderly. The EU-CaRE RCT investigated the effectiveness of a home-based mobile CR programme in elderly patients that were not willing to participate in centre-based CR. The initial study concluded that a 6-month home-based mobile CR programme was safe and beneficial in improving VO2peak when compared with no CR. To assess whether a 6-month guided mobile CR programme is a cost-effective therapy for elderly patients who decline participation in CR. Patients were enrolled in a multicentre randomised clinical trial from November 11, 2015, to January 3, 2018, and follow-up was completed on January 17, 2019, in a secondary care system with 6 cardiac institutions across 5 European countries. A total of 179 patients who declined participation in centre-based CR and met the inclusion criteria consented to participate in the European Study on Effectiveness and Sustainability of Current Cardiac Rehabilitation Programs in the Elderly trial. The data of patients (n = 17) that were lost in follow-up were excluded from this analysis. The intervention (n = 79) consisted of 6 months of mobile CR programme with telemonitoring, and coaching based on motivational interviewing to stimulate patients to reach exercise goals. Control patients did not receive any form of CR throughout the study period. The costs considered for the cost-effectiveness analysis of the RCT are direct costs 1) of the mobile CR programme, and 2) of the care utilisation recorded during the observation time from randomisation to the end of the study. Costs and outcomes (utilities) were compared by calculation of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. The healthcare utilisation costs (P = 0.802) were not significantly different between the two groups. However, the total costs were significantly higher in the intervention group (P = 0.040). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for the primary endpoint VO2peak at 6 months was €1085 per 1-unit [ml/kg/min] improvement in change VO2peak and at 12 months it was €1103 per 1 unit [ml/kg/min] improvement in change VO2peak. Big differences in the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for the primary endpoint VO2peak at 6 months and 12 months were present between the adherent participants and the non-adherent participants. From a health-economic point of view the home-based mobile CR programme is an effective and cost-effective alternative for elderly cardiac patients who are not willing to participate in a regular rehabilitation programme to improve cardiorespiratory fitness. The change of QoL between the mobile CR was similar for both groups. Adherence to the mobile CR programme plays a significant role in the cost-effectiveness of the intervention.

Sixty-one PwMS were randomized to mindfulness-based training (MBT), adaptive computerized cognitive training (aCT), or a waitlist (WL) control group and completed the Brief Repeatable Battery of Neuropsychological Tests at pre- and posttraining. Training-related changes on the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) and the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT) were the primary outcomes of interest. Baseline cognitive status was examined as a moderator of treatment gains. Practice time, change in aCT game difficulty, and rate of change in state awareness across MBT were assessed as correlates of cognitive gains. Compared with aCT and WL, mindfulness training significantly improved processing speed (ηp² = .14). Baseline cognitive status did not moderate change in processing speed (ηp² = .005) or working memory (ηp² = .014). Practice time and change in game difficulty were not significantly correlated with cognitive gains (all ps > .49). In the MBT group, rate of change in awareness was significantly associated with improvement in working memory (ρ = .52, p = .04). In PwMS, 4 weeks of mindfulness meditation training improved processing speed above and beyond aCT and WL. More rapid change in awareness during mindfulness training may be associated with greater gains in working memory.

Mass drug administration (MDA) with azithromycin (AZ) is being considered as a strategy to promote child survival in sub-Saharan Africa, but the mechanism by which AZ reduces mortality is unclear. To better understand the nature and extent of protection provided by AZ, we explored the profile of protection by time since administration, using data from a household-randomized, placebo-controlled trial in Burkina Faso and Mali. Between 2014 and 2016, 30 977 children aged 3-59 months received seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC) with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine plus amodiaquine and either AZ or placebo monthly, on 4 occasions each year. Poisson regression with gamma-distributed random effects, accounting for the household randomization and within-individual clustering of illness episodes, was used to compare incidence of prespecified outcomes between SMC+AZ versus SMC+placebo groups in fixed time strata post-treatment. The likelihood ratio test was used to assess evidence for a time-treatment group interaction. Relative to SMC+placebo, there was no evidence of protection from SMC+AZ against hospital admissions and deaths. Additional protection from SMC+AZ against malaria was confined to the first 2 weeks post-administration (protective efficacy (PE): 24.2% [95% CI: 17.8%, 30.1%]). Gastroenteritis and pneumonia were reduced by 29.9% [21.7; 37.3%], and 34.3% [14.9; 49.3%], respectively, in the first 2 weeks postadministration. Protection against nonmalaria fevers with a skin condition persisted up to 28 days: PE: 46.3% [35.1; 55.6%]. The benefits of AZ-MDA are broad-ranging but short-lived. To maximize impact, timing of AZ-MDA must address the challenge of targeting asynchronous morbidity and mortality peaks from different causes.", "labels": [[727, 752, "Patient"], [866, 881, "Control"], [1141, 1152, "Control"], [1822, 1878, "TOREMOVE"], [4, 26, "Outcome"], [32, 44, "Intervention"], [53, 118, "Outcome"], [124, 172, "Intervention"], [541, 604, "Outcome"], [646, 653, "Control"], [753, 862, "Intervention"], [1127, 1133, "Intervention"], [1372, 1402, "Outcome"]]}
{"id": 35, "text": "Effects of Treating an Overactive Urinary Bladder in Patients with Multiple Sclerosis. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of the anticholinergic therapy with oxybutynin and the effects of daily transcutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (TTNS) on the quality of life of patients with an overactive bladder (OAB) and multiple sclerosis (MS). The study was designed as a randomized controlled trial. The patients who suffer from MS underwent urodynamic tests which showed that they had an OAB. The tests used to assess symptoms and quality of life were Overactive Bladder Questionnaires (OAB-q) SF. Patients were divided into 2 groups of 30 patients each. The first group received a 5 mg oxybutynin tablet twice a day for 3 months and the second group had TTNS every day for 3 months. The anticholinergic therapy showed a statistically significant improvement in all symptoms and quality of life (P<0.001). Side effects such as dry mouth were observed in about 35% of patients. The results of the study TTNS daily therapy showed good performance in the reduction all clin ical symptoms of the bladder and improved quality of life, with statistical significance (P<0.05) and with no side effects. It was found that the improved quality of life parameters and the reduced symptoms were more statistically significant in the treatment with oxybutynin tablets than TTNS therapy (P<0.001). Our recommendation for the treatment of OAB is oxybutynin in doses of 2x5 mg. If a patient can not tolerate anticholinergic drugs, daily TTNS is recommended to reduce OAB symptoms and improve quality of life, without side effects.", "labels": [[11, 49, "Intervention"], [53, 85, "Patient"], [120, 143, "Outcome"], [270, 286, "Outcome"], [289, 358, "Patient"], [151, 190, "Intervention"], [210, 262, "Control"], [511, 614, "Outcome"], [677, 747, "Intervention"], [756, 800, "Control"], [1480, 1632, "TOREMOVE"]]}
{"id": 231, "text": "Budget impact analysis of betrixaban for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in nonsurgical patients with acute medical illness in the United Kingdom. Venous thromboembolism (VTE) incurs substantial costs to the UK National Health Service (NHS). Betrixaban is approved in the US for VTE prophylaxis with a recommended 35-42 days of treatment. This analysis modeled the budget impact of introducing betrixaban for extended-duration VTE prophylaxis in nonsurgical patients with acute medical illness at risk of VTE in the UK, where it is not yet licensed. The 5-year budget impact of introducing betrixaban into current prophylaxis (low molecular weight heparin and fondaparinux) was estimated for the UK NHS. The Phase 3 APEX study provided primary event (VTE, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and death; all-cause or VTE-related) and treatment complications data. Literature informed risk of recurrent events and long-term complications, population, market share, and costs for treatment and management of events. Network meta-analyses informed symptomatic DVT, pulmonary embolism and VTE-related death rates in fondaparinux patients. Deterministic sensitivity analyses explored uncertainty. Introducing betrixaban accrued savings of £1,290,000-£23,000,000 in years 1-5. Savings were from reduced primary VTE events, which reduced recurrent events and future complications. All sensitivity analyses showed savings. Introducing extended-duration VTE prophylaxis with betrixaban in the UK would accrue substantial savings annually over the next 5 years compared to current prophylaxis.
