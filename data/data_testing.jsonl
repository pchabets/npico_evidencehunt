To evaluate the effect of low-level laser therapy (LLLT) on the success rate of inferior alveolar nerve blocks (IANB) in mandibular molar teeth with symptomatic irreversible pulpitis (SIP). Eighty-eight patients who were diagnosed with SIP were randomly divided into two groups: the group in which only IANB was applied and the group in which IANB + LLLT was applied. IANB was applied to patients in the control group with 4% articaine. LLLT was applied to the patients in the experimental group in addition to IANB. The pain experienced during the operation was evaluated using a visual analog scale. If the patients reported moderate or severe pain during the treatment, the IANB was defined as unsuccessful. Pearson's chi-square test was used to analyse anaesthetic success rates. Whilst the anaesthesia success rate was 34% in the group where only IANB was applied, it was 57% in the group in which LLLT was applied in addition to IANB. There was a significant difference between the groups (p = .032). The application of LLLT to support IANB in mandibular molar teeth with SIP increased the success of anaesthesia.

To describe the demographic, injury-related, and mental health characteristics of firearm injury patients and trace firearm weapon carriage and PTSD symptoms over the year after injury. Based on the increasing incidence of firearm injury and need for novel injury prevention strategies, hospital-based violence intervention programs are being implemented in US trauma centers. There is limited data on the long-term outcomes and risk behaviors of firearm injury survivors to guide this work. We conducted a secondary analysis of a pragmatic 25-trauma center randomized trial (N = 635). Baseline characteristics of firearm-injured patients (N = 128) were compared with other trauma patients. Mixed model regression was used to identify risk factors for postinjury firearm weapon carriage and PTSD symptoms. Firearm injury patients were younger and more likely to be black, male and of lower socioeconomic status, and more likely to carry a firearm in the year before injury. Relative to preinjury, there was a significant drop in firearm weapon carriage at 3- and 6-months postinjury, followed by a return to preinjury levels at 12-months. Firearm injury was significantly and independently associated with an increased risk of postinjury firearm weapon carriage [relative risk = 2.08, 95% confidence interval (1.34, 3.22), P < 0.01] and higher PTSD symptom levels [Beta = 3.82, 95% confidence interval (1.29, 6.35), P < 0.01]. Firearm injury survivors are at risk for firearm carriage and high PTSD symptom levels postinjury.

Arteriovenous fistula puncture pain is a serious problem for patients undergoing dialysis and a good indication for topical anesthetics. No previous study has compared lidocaine/prilocaine cream (EMLA) with lidocaine tape for pain relief during arteriovenous fistula puncture in patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis. To this end, we conducted a multicenter randomized crossover study including 66 patients (mean age, 65.8 years; males, 57.6%) undergoing maintenance hemodialysis thrice/week. Subjects were assigned to Sequence EL (EMLA administration followed by lidocaine, with 1-week wash-out) or Sequence LE (reverse administration, first lidocaine then EMLA). All subjects completed the study. At each puncture site, 1 g EMLA (25 mg lidocaine + 25 mg prilocaine) or one sheet of lidocaine tape (18 mg lidocaine) was applied 1 h or 30 min prior to arteriovenous fistula puncture, respectively. The primary endpoint was puncture pain relief, which was measured using a 100-mm visual analog scale. The secondary endpoints included quality of life, which was measured by SF-36, and safety. EMLA produced a 10.1-mm greater visual analog scale improvement than lidocaine tape (P = 0.00001). However, there was no statistically significant difference in the quality of life between the two groups, and no significant carryover/period effect was observed in any analysis. Further, no drug-related adverse events were observed.

Here, we propose a method for SARS-CoV-2 viral enrichment and enzymatic extraction of RNA from clinically relevant matrices in under 10 min. This technique utilizes affinity-capture hydrogel particles to concentrate SARS-CoV-2 from solution, and leverages existing PDQeX technology for RNA isolation. Characterization of our method is accomplished with reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for relative, comparative RNA detection. In a double-blind study analyzing viral transport media (VTM) obtained from clinical nasopharyngeal swabs, our sample preparation method demonstrated both comparable results to a routinely used commercial extraction kit and 100% concordance with laboratory diagnoses. Compatibility of eluates with alternative forms of analysis was confirmed using microfluidic RT-PCR (μRT-PCR), recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP). The alternative methods explored here conveyed successful amplification from all RNA eluates originating from positive clinical samples.

Anti-tuberculous therapy (ATT) alone cannot easily cure spine tuberculosis (STB) though it is the most essential treatment. Many studies have confirmed the efficacy of the surgical treatment of STB through anterior, anterolateral, posterior debridement, and intervertebral fusion or combined with internal fixation. However, the conventional surgical approach requires extensive exposure of the affected areas with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Recently, minimally invasive surgery has come into use to reduce iatrogenic trauma and relevant complications. Here, we introduced a novel technique for the treatment of thoracic and lumbar spine tuberculosis: minimally invasive far lateral debridement and posterior instrumentation (MI-FLDPI). In this study, we evaluated the technical feasibility, the clinical outcomes, and the postoperative complications. We did a prospective, non-randomized study on this new technique. Twenty three patients (13 males) with thoracic or lumbar spine tuberculosis who underwent minimally invasive far lateral debridement and posterior instrumentation were included in the study. The preoperative comorbidities, operation duration, intra-operative hemorrhage, Cobb's angles, and postoperative complications were recorded and analyzed. Clinical outcomes were evaluated by Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), neurological recovery, and eradication of tuberculosis. Radiological outcomes were evaluated by changes in Cobb's angle and fusion status of the affected segments. The patients were followed for an average of 19 months (ranging from 12 to 36 months). At the final follow-up, CRP and ESR of all patients were normal. The VAS and ODI were significantly improved compared with preoperative values (P < 0.05). No evident progression of the kyphotic deformity was found after surgery. Twenty two patients showed spontaneous peripheral interbody fusion 1 year after surgery. There were no failure of the instrumentation even though a young female with drug-resistant tuberculosis showed no sign of interbody fusion at the third year follow-up. All the patients with preoperative neurological deficit showed complete recovery at the final follow-up.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the DEHP and MEHP content in blood following the heated ES transfusions administered by DEHP-containing and DEHP-free infusion sets. The study included 30 patients that were randomly divided into two groups with 15 patients each: group I underwent ES transfusion via DEHP-containing infusion sets warmed with blood-fluid warmers, and group II underwent ES transfusion via DEHP-free infusion sets warmed with blood-fluid warmers. DEHP and MEHP levels were measured both before and after transfusion. DEHP-free infusion sets led to no increase in the phthalate content, whereas DEHP-containing infusion sets significantly increased the DEHP and MEHP, where the DEHP level increased almost four times (P = .001).

Given the scale of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the development of vaccines based on different platforms is essential, particularly in light of emerging viral variants, the absence of information on vaccine-induced immune durability, and potential paediatric use. We aimed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of an MF59-adjuvanted subunit vaccine for COVID-19 based on recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein stabilised in a pre-fusion conformation by a novel molecular clamp (spike glycoprotein-clamp [sclamp]). We did a phase 1, double-blind, placebo-controlled, block-randomised trial of the sclamp subunit vaccine in a single clinical trial site in Brisbane, QLD, Australia. Healthy adults (aged ≥18 to ≤55 years) who had tested negative for SARS-CoV-2, reported no close contact with anyone with active or previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, and tested negative for pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 immunity were included. Participants were randomly assigned to one of five treatment groups and received two doses via intramuscular injection 28 days apart of either placebo, sclamp vaccine at 5 μg, 15 μg, or 45 μg, or one dose of sclamp vaccine at 45 μg followed by placebo. Participants and study personnel, except the dose administration personnel, were masked to treatment. The primary safety endpoints included solicited local and systemic adverse events in the 7 days after each dose and unsolicited adverse events up to 12 months after dosing.

Unsolicited adverse events occurred in seven (29%) of 24 participants receiving placebo and 35 (36%) of 96 participants receiving the SARS-CoV-2 sclamp vaccine at any dose. Vaccination with SARS-CoV-2 sclamp elicited a similar antigen-specific response irrespective of dose: 4 weeks after the initial dose (day 29) with 5 μg dose (geometric mean titre [GMT] 6400, 95% CI 3683-11 122), with 15 μg dose (7492, 4959-11 319), and the two 45 μg dose cohorts (8770, 5526-13 920 in the two-dose 45 μg cohort; 8793, 5570-13 881 in the single-dose 45 μg cohort); 4 weeks after the second dose (day 57) with two 5 μg doses (102 400, 64 857-161 676), with two 15 μg doses (74 725, 51 300-108 847), with two 45 μg doses (79 586, 55 430-114 268), only a single 45 μg dose (4795, 2858-8043). At day 57, 67 (99%) of 68 participants who received two doses of sclamp vaccine at any concentration produced a neutralising immune response, compared with six (25%) of 24 who received a single 45 μg dose and none of 22 who received placebo. Participants receiving two doses of sclamp vaccine elicited similar neutralisation titres, irrespective of dose: two 5 μg doses (GMT 228, 95% CI 146-356), two 15 μg doses (230, 170-312), and two 45 μg doses (239, 187-307).

Attenuated psychosis syndrome (APS), a condition for further study in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5, comprises psychotic symptoms that are qualitatively similar to those observed in schizophrenia but are less severe. Patients with APS are at high risk of converting to first-episode psychosis (FEP). As evidence for effective pharmacological interventions in APS is limited, novel treatments may provide symptomatic relief and delay/prevent psychotic conversion. This trial aims to investigate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of BI 409306, a potent and selective phosphodiesterase-9 inhibitor, versus placebo in APS. Novel biomarkers of psychosis are being investigated. In this Phase II, multinational, double-blind, parallel-group trial, randomized (1:1) patients will receive BI 409306 50 mg or placebo twice daily for 52 weeks. Patients (n = 300) will be enrolled to determine time to remission of APS, time to FEP, change in everyday functional capacity (Schizophrenia Cognition Rating Scale), and change from baseline in Brief Assessment of Cognition composite score and Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale scores. Potential biomarkers of psychosis under investigation include functional measures of brain activity and automated speech analyses. Safety is being assessed throughout. This trial will determine whether BI 409306 is superior to placebo in achieving sustainable remission of APS and improvements in cognition and functional capacity.

Px563L has the potential to deliver an improved safety and immunogenicity profile relative to the currently licensed vaccine, which is produced from filtered B. anthracis culture supernatants. We conducted a Phase 1, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study in 54 healthy subjects to evaluate Px563L at 3 dose levels of mrPA (10, 50, and 80 mcg). For each dose level, 18 subjects were randomized in an 8:8:2 ratio to Px563L (mrPA with adjuvant), RPA563 (mrPA only) or placebo (saline). Each subject received an intramuscular (IM) injection on Day 0 and Day 28. Primary safety and immunogenicity analysis was conducted after all subjects completed the Day70 visit, a duration deemed clinically relevant for post-exposure prophylaxis. Long-term safety was assessed through Day 393. Vaccinations with Px563L at all dose levels were well-tolerated. There were no serious adverse events or adverse events (AE) leading to early withdrawal. In all treatment groups, most AEs were due to injection site reactions, and all AEs at the 10 and 50 mcg dose levels were mild.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is an experimental study. Its data were collected in the infectious diseases clinic of a research hospital from May to August, 2020. This study was carried out with 67 COVID-19 patients (33 in the experimental group and 34 in the control group). The data were collected using a personal information form, the state-trait anxiety inventory, and the Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire. The progressive muscle relaxation exercises were performed twice a day for 5 days with the researcher's supervision. The data were analyzed using means, numbers, percentage distributions, the χ  2  test, the dependent t test, and the independent t test. Statistically significant differences were found between the experimental and control groups' mean posttest scores on the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and the Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire (p < 0.05). The in-group comparison of the experimental group found a statistically significant difference between their mean pretest and posttest scores on the State Anxiety Scale (p < 0.05). The in-group comparison of the control group found no statistically significant changes in their mean pretest and posttest scores on the State Anxiety Scale (p > 0.05).

Migraine is a debilitating neurological condition, affecting up to 15% of Americans. Recent estimates from a long-term safety study of rimegepant showed evidence of decreased monthly migraine days (MMD) in people with episodic migraine treated with rimegepant 75 mg. The objective of this study was to characterize migraine-specific quality of life version 2.1 (MSQv2) scores and corresponding mapped EuroQol-5 Dimensions-3 Level (EQ-5D-3L) utility values. Study participants were randomized into two treatment regimens: individuals with 2-14 MMD received rimegepant 75 mg as needed (PRN), and those with 4-14 MMD at baseline who received rimegepant on a fixed every-other-day schedule plus an as needed dose on days they did not treat (QOD + PRN). MSQv2 was mapped to EQ-5D-3L utilities using a validated algorithm. Outcomes were assessed for the PRN arm at baseline weeks 12, 24, 36, and 52 and for the QOD + PRN arm at baseline and week 12. At baseline, MSQv2 data were available for 1,800 patients: 1,033 with 2-8 MMD in the PRN group, 481 with 9-14 MMD in the PRN group, and 286 with 4-14 MMD in the QOD + PRN group. For all MSQv2 domains as well as mapped utility values, outcomes improved over each study visit. At baseline, EQ-5D-3L utilities were 0.66, 0.63, and 0.65 for the 2-8 MMD PRN, 9-14 MMD PRN, and 4-14 MMD QOD + PRN groups, respectively. At end-of-study, utilities had increased by + 0.09, + 0.10, and + 0.12 for the three groups, respectively (p < 0.001 for all comparisons with baseline). Similar trends in improvement were observed across MSQv2 subdomains; all differences were statistically significant. Rimegepant 75 mg, which has been shown to be associated with reduced MMD, is associated with improvement in MSQv2 domains over time, leading to estimated improvement in EQ-5D-3L utilities.

Acne vulgaris is the most common dermatological disorder worldwide, causing significant physical and psychological morbidity. Topical combination therapy has shown superior efficacy compared to monotherapy, especially when combined with retinoids. Few studies have directly compared combined formulations. This evaluator-blinded pilot study compared the efficacy and tolerability of two marketed topical combination acne gels, clindamycin 1%-tretinoin 0.025% (CT) and benzoyl peroxide 2.5%-adapalene 0.1% (BA) in 20 patients with mild to moderate acne vulgaris. Gels were applied daily on opposite sides of the face for 21 days. The primary outcome was difference in transepidermal water loss (TEWL) at the end of treatment. Secondary endpoints were skin moisture content measurement, Investigators' Global Assessment, subject self-assessments (SSA) of burning/stinging, itching, erythema, and dryness/scaling, and Comparative Participant Satisfaction Questionnaire (CPSQ). Efficacy was assessed by inflammatory and non- inflammatory acne efflorescences counts. TEWL increased significantly for both CT and BA (+57.74%, P=0.002; +58.77%, P<0.001); skin moisture content significantly decreased only for BA (-16.47%, P=0.02). Only BA showed a significant increase in erythema and dryness/scaling (P=0.027 and P=0.014) and in SSA burning/stinging (P=0.04). Patient satisfaction evaluation also reflected the strong BA irritation. Although CT and BA both reduced acne lesions (P<0.001) and more patients preferred to continue with CT, subject perception of acne improvement was higher for BA. These findings suggest that CT and BA have similar efficacy in the treatment of mild to moderate papulopustular acne. However, CT was better tolerated than BA by both medical and subject evaluation.

This clinical trial was performed on 120 hypertensive patients who were provided with a mobile intervention for 8 weeks and followed up until the 24th week. Data on the primary outcome (adherence to treatment) and secondary outcomes (adherence to the DASH diet, regular monitoring of blood pressure, and physical activity) were collected using a questionnaire and a mobile application, respectively. The inter-group change difference over time was analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA (general linear model). The treatment adherence score increased by an average of 5.9 (95% CI 5.0-6.7) in the intervention group compared to the control group. The scores of adherence to the low-fat and low-salt diet plans were 1.7 (95% CI 1.3-2.1) and 1.5 (95% CI 1.2-1.9), respectively. Moreover, moderate physical activity increased to 100.0 min (95% CI 61.7-138.3) per week in the intervention group.

Blinded data from the BE RADIANT phase 3b trial of bimekizumab were analysed. In BE RADIANT, patients were randomised 1:1 to bimekizumab 320 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W) or secukinumab 300 mg (weekly until Week 4, then Q4W). Three items (itching, skin pain and scaling) of the P-SIM were electronically assessed throughout the trial and were scored from 0 to 10 (none to very severe signs/symptoms/impacts). Test-retest reliability was determined using intraclass correlations. Convergent validity was assessed between P-SIM and other relevant PRO and clinician-reported outcome (ClinRO) scores. Known-groups validity was assessed by comparing mean P-SIM item scores between patient subgroups based on the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI)/Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) scores. Responsiveness was assessed via correlations between changes from baseline in P-SIM item scores and other relevant PRO and ClinRO scores. Anchor-based responder analyses and empirical cumulative distribution function (eCDF) curves determined responder thresholds. The three P-SIM items yielded high intraclass coefficients (> 0.70). By Week 48, the three P-SIM items had moderate (> 0.30 and ≤ 0.50) to strong (> 0.50) correlations with other PROs and weaker correlations with ClinROs, demonstrating good convergent validity. For almost all known-group comparisons, statistically significant between-subgroup score differences were seen across all three P-SIM items. Changes from baseline in the P-SIM and other relevant outcomes were above the acceptable threshold of ≤ 0.30, demonstrating sensitivity to change. Anchor-based analyses determined a ≥ four-point reduction from baseline to indicate marked clinically meaningful improvement for the P-SIM.

In this retrospective study, we investigated the potential value of CT texture features to diagnose LN metastasis using preoperative CT data and patient characteristics by developing quantitative prediction models. A total of 390 CC patients, undergone surgical resection, were enrolled in this monocentric study. 390 histologically validated LNs were collected from patients and randomly separated into training (312 patients, 155 metastatic and 157 normal LNs) and test cohorts (78 patients, 39 metastatic and 39 normal LNs). Six patient characteristics and 146 quantitative CT imaging features were analyzed and key variables were determined using either exhaustive search or least absolute shrinkage algorithm. Two kernel-based support vector machine classifiers (patient-characteristic model and radiomic-derived model), generated with 10-fold cross-validation, were compared with the clinical model that utilizes long-axis diameter for diagnosis of metastatic LN. The performance of the models was evaluated on the test cohort by computing accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating curve (AUC).

Data regarding vessel healing by optical coherence tomography (OCT) after everolimus-eluting bioresorbable scaffolds (BRS) or everolimus-eluting metallic stent (EES) implantation in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients is scarce. We compared OCT findings after BRS or EES implantation in patients with AMI enrolled in a randomized trial. In ISAR-Absorb MI, AMI patients were randomized to BRS or EES implantation, with 6-8 month angiographic follow-up. This analysis includes patients who underwent OCT during surveillance angiography.

Unwanted weight gain affects some people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) who are prescribed integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs). Mechanisms and risk factors are incompletely understood. We utilized 2 cohorts to study pharmacogenetics of weight gain following switch from efavirenz- to INSTI-based regimens. In an observational cohort, we studied weight gain at 48 weeks following switch from efavirenz- to INSTI-based regimens among patients who had been virologically suppressed for at least 2 years at a clinic in the United States. Associations were characterized with CYP2B6 and UGT1A1 genotypes that affect efavirenz and INSTI metabolism, respectively. In a clinical trials cohort, we studied weight gain at 48 weeks among treatment-naive participants who were randomized to receive efavirenz-containing regimens in AIDS Clinical Trials Group studies A5095, A5142, and A5202 and did not receive INSTIs. In the observational cohort (n = 61), CYP2B6 slow metabolizers had greater weight gain after switch (P = .01). This was seen following switch to elvitegravir or raltegravir, but not dolutegravir. UGT1A1 genotype was not associated with weight gain.

Peripherally inserted central venous catheters (PICCs) are increasingly used for parenteral access in critically ill hospitalized patients, but they increase the incidence of upper extremity deep venous thrombosis (UE DVT). Sequential compression devices (SCDs) applied to the legs effectively reduce lower extremity DVT, but have not been tested in the arms. Our objective was to determine whether SCDs applied to the arm may reduce the risk of PICC-associated UE DVT. This was a retrospective study of randomized, single-center, controlled clinical trial on patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit with critical neurological illness who had a PICC and were not receiving anticoagulants. Between January 2014 and October 2016, patients were randomized 1:1 to an intervention group having a custom SCD applied to the arm harboring the PICC or to a control group. The primary endpoint was ultrasound-detected UE DVT. Following randomization of 77 subjects, the study was terminated due to excess DVT in the treatment arm.

In the SEARCH (Sustainable East Africa Research in Community Health) Study (NCT01864603), 32 communities in rural Uganda and Kenya were randomized to country-guided antiretroviral therapy (ART) versus streamlined ART care that included rapid ART start, visit spacing, flexible clinic hours, and welcoming environment. We assessed persons with HIV and CD4 ≤ 350/uL, ART eligible in both arms, and estimated the effect of streamlined care on ART initiation and mortality at 3 years. Comparisons between study arms used a cluster-level analysis with survival estimates from Kaplan-Meier; estimates of ART start among ART-naive persons treated death as a competing risk. Among 13 266 adults with HIV, 2973 (22.4%) had CD4 ≤ 350/uL. Of these, 33% were new diagnoses, and 10% were diagnosed but ART-naive.

Small fibre neuropathy is a common pain disorder, which in many cases fails to respond to treatment with existing medications. Gain-of-function mutations of voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.7 underlie dorsal root ganglion neuronal hyperexcitability and pain in a subset of patients with small fibre neuropathy. Recent clinical studies have demonstrated that lacosamide, which blocks sodium channels in a use-dependent manner, attenuates pain in some patients with Nav1.7 mutations; however, only a subgroup of these patients responded to the drug. Here, we used voltage-clamp recordings to evaluate the effects of lacosamide on five Nav1.7 variants from patients who were responsive or non-responsive to treatment. We show that, at the clinically achievable concentration of 30 μM, lacosamide acts as a potent sodium channel inhibitor of Nav1.7 variants carried by responsive patients, via a hyperpolarizing shift of voltage-dependence of both fast and slow inactivation and enhancement of use-dependent inhibition. By contrast, the effects of lacosamide on slow inactivation and use-dependence in Nav1.7 variants from non-responsive patients were less robust. Importantly, we found that lacosamide selectively enhances fast inactivation only in variants from responders.

Age of onset; duration of untreated psychosis; depressive, positive and negative symptoms; and intervention condition were significantly different between good (higher-improving trajectory) and poor (combined lower-stable and deteriorating trajectories) trajectory groups. Multiple regression analysis revealed that younger age of onset, more severe depression and receipt of step-down care independently predicted poor subjective quality of life trajectory. Approximately one-third of patients displayed poor subjective quality of life trajectory in the early phase of psychotic illness. Our results affirm depression as a critical determinant of prospective subjective quality of life and underscores positive effect of extended early intervention on sustained subjective quality of life improvement.

In this preliminary report, we aim to describe the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of adult critically ill COVID-19 patients, requiring invasive mechanical ventilation (iMV), and receiving IL-6RA and steroids therapy over the last 11 months. International, multicenter, cohort study derived from Viral Infection and Respiratory Illness University Study registry and conducted through Discovery Network, Society of Critical Care Medicine. Data were collected between March 01, 2020, and January 10, 2021. Of 860 patients who met eligibility criteria, 589 received steroids, 170 IL-6RAs, and 101 combinations. Patients who received IL-6RAs were younger (median age of 57.5 years vs. 61.1 and 61.8 years in the steroids and combination groups, respectively). The median C-reactive protein level was > 75 mg/L, indicating a hyperinflammatory phenotype. The median daily steroid dose was 7.5 mg dexamethasone or equivalent (interquartile range: 6-14 mg); 80.8% and 19.2% received low-dose and high-dose steroids, respectively. Of the patients who received IL-6RAs, the majority received one dose of tocilizumab and sarilumab (dose range of 600-800 mg for tocilizumab and 200-400 mg for sarilumab). Regarding the timing of administration, we observed that steroid and IL-6RA administration on day 0 of ICU admission was only 55.6% and 39.5%, respectively. By day 28, when compared with steroid use alone, IL-6RA use was associated with an adjusted incidence rate ratio (aIRR) of 1.12 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.88, 1.4) for ventilator-free days, while combination therapy was associated with an aIRR of 0.83 (95% CI 0.6, 1.14). IL-6RA use was associated with an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of 0.68 (95% CI 0.44, 1.07) for the 28-day mortality rate, while combination therapy was associated with an aOR of 1.07 (95% CI 0.67, 1.70).

To investigate the reproducibility of diffusion-weighted (DW) MRI and  18 F-Fluorodeoxyglucose ( 18 F-FDG)-Positron emission tomography/CT (PET/CT) in monitoring response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in epithelial ovarian cancer. Ten women (median age, 67 years; range: 41.8-77.3 years) with stage IIIC-IV epithelial ovarian cancers were included in this prospective trial (NCT02792959) between 2014 and 2016. All underwent initial laparoscopic staging, four cycles of carboplatine-paclitaxel-based chemotherapy and interval debulking surgery. PET/CT and DW-MRI were performed at baseline (C0), after one cycle (C1) and before surgery (C4). Two nuclear physicians and two radiologists assessed five anatomic sites for the presence of ≥1 lesion. Target lesions in each site were defined and their apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), maximal standardized uptake value (SUV-max), SUV-mean, SUL-peak, metabolic tumor volume (MTV) and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) were monitored (i.e., 10 patients ×5 sites ×3 time-points). Their relative early and late changes were calculated. Intra/inter-observer reproducibilities of qualitative and quantitative analysis were estimated with Kappa and intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs). For both modalities, inter- and intra-observer agreement percentages were excellent for initial staging but declined later for DW-MRI, leading to lower Kappa values for inter- and intra-observer variability (0.949 and 1 at C0, vs. 0.633 and 0.643 at C4, respectively) while Kappa values remained>0.8 for PET/CT.

A 2-week double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study assessed the efficacy of dipyridamole (possible up-titration to 300 mg) in untreated patients with idiopathic restless legs syndrome. Multiple suggested immobilization tests and polysomnography were performed after each treatment phase. Severity was assessed weekly using the International Restless Legs Rating Scale, Clinical Global Impression, and the Medical Outcomes Study Sleep scale. The primary end point was therapeutic response. Twenty-eight of 29 patients recruited were included. International Restless Legs Rating Scale scores improved from a mean ± standard deviation of 24.1 ± 3.1 at baseline to 11.1 ± 2.3 at the end of week 2, versus 23.7 ± 3.4 to 18.7 ± 3.2 under placebo (P < 0.001).

Sleep variables improved. The mean periodic leg movement index at the end of treatment with dipyridamole was 8.2 ± 3.5 versus. 28.1 ± 6.7 under placebo. Side effects (dipyridamole vs placebo) included abdominal distension (18% vs. 7%), dizziness (10.7% vs 7.1%), diarrhea, and asthenia (each 7.1% vs 3.6%). Dipyridamole has significant therapeutic effects on both sensory and motor symptoms of restless legs syndrome and on sleep. Our findings confirm the efficacy of dipyridamole in restless legs syndrome predicted from preclinical studies and support a key role of adenosine in restless legs syndrome. © 2021 The Authors.

{"id": "31388712", "text": "Features of urine S100B and its ability to rule out intracranial hemorrhage in patients with head trauma: a prospective trial. Traumatic brain injury causes morbidity and mortality worldwide. S100B is the most documented emergency brain biomarker and its urine-assay might be advantageous because of easier sampling. The primary aim was to evaluate urine S100B's ability to rule out intracranial hemorrhage. Secondary aims included S100B temporal pattern for 48 h post-trauma and chemical properties of urine that affect urine S100B. Patients with head trauma were sampled for serum and urine S100B. Patients who were admitted for intracranial hemorrhage were sampled for 48 h to assess S100B-level, renal function, urine-pH, etc. RESULTS: The negative predictive value of serum S100B was 97.0% [95% confidence interval (CI) 89.5-99.2%] and that of urine S100B was 89.1% (95% CI 85.5-91.9%). The specificity of serum S100B was 34.4% (95% CI 27.7-41.6%) and that of urine was 67.1% (95% CI 59.4-74.1%). Urine-pH correlated strongly with urine S100B during the first 6-h post-trauma. Trend-analysis of receiver operator characteristics of S100B in serum, urine the arithmetic difference between serum and urine S100B showed the largest area under the curve for arithmetic difference, which had a negative predictive value of 93.1% (95% CI 89.1-95.8%) and a specificity of 71.8% (95% CI 64.4-78.4%). This study cannot support ruling out intracranial hemorrhage with urine S100B. Urine-pH might affect urine S100B and merits further studies. Serum and urine S100B have poor concordance and interchangeability. The arithmetic difference had a slightly better area under the curve and can be worth exploring in certain subgroups.", "labels": [[79, 104, "Patient"], [374, 406, "Outcome"], [432, 532, "Outcome"], [0, 23, "Intervention"], [43, 75, "Outcome"], [349, 362, "Intervention"], [534, 559, "Patient"], [565, 598, "Intervention"], [600, 654, "Patient"], [660, 730, "Outcome"], [1397, 1475, "O"]]}
{"id": "33547713", "text": "Impact of continuous positive airway pressure mode on adherence to treatment in obstructive sleep apnea patients awaiting bariatric surgery. Obstructive sleep apnea is prevalent in the bariatric population, and is associated with various complications. Despite increasing popularity, automatic positive airway pressure has not yet been studied in this population. The objective was to compare treatment adherence between automatic positive airway pressure and fixed positive airway pressure (continuous positive airway pressure) in obstructive sleep apnea patients awaiting bariatric surgery. This randomized controlled trial involved obese patients newly diagnosed with severe obstructive sleep apnea and awaiting bariatric surgery. The primary outcome was the difference in adherence between automatic positive airway pressure and continuous positive airway pressure pre-operatively. Secondary outcomes included positive airway pressure efficacy, adherence at 1 month, adverse effects, quality of life and peri-operative complications. Analyses were conducted using a modified intention-to-treat methodology. Fifty patients were randomized. Baseline characteristics and duration of positive airway pressure therapy were comparable between groups. At the time of surgery, the percentage of overall nights positive airway pressure used was 96.9% [95% confidence interval: 93.5-100] and 86.0% [95% confidence interval: 66.9-100] in the automatic positive airway pressure and continuous positive airway pressure groups, respectively (p = .047). Average use was 6.3 hr per night [95% confidence interval: 5.1-7.2] and 5.9 hr per night [95% confidence interval: 3.0-8.8], with a difference of 0.4 hr favouring automatic positive airway pressure (p = .75). Nightly use ≥ 4 hr per night was 86.4% and 74.0% in the automatic positive airway pressure and fixed continuous positive airway pressure groups, respectively (p = .22). There were no statistically significant differences regarding adherence at 1 month, efficacy parameters, adverse effects, quality of life and peri-operative complications. With no difference on the safety profile and efficiency parameters, treatment adherence is not improved with automatic positive airway pressure compared with fixed continuous positive airway pressure in obstructive sleep apnea patients awaiting bariatric surgery.", "labels": [[80, 139, "Patient"], [532, 591, "Patient"], [635, 732, "Patient"], [833, 868, "Intervention"], [2093, 2355, "O"], [10, 50, "Intervention"], [54, 76, "Outcome"], [393, 412, "Outcome"], [421, 455, "Control"], [460, 528, "Intervention"], [762, 785, "Outcome"], [794, 828, "Control"], [914, 1036, "Outcome"]]}
