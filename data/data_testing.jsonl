Between May 2018 and September 2019, 45 female patients with osteoporosis were included in the randomized clinical study, their age ranged from 40 to 50 years, had thyroidectomy for at least 6 months ago, and had an inactive lifestyle for at least the previous 6 months. Patients were assigned randomly into 3 equal groups. Group A (magnetic therapy group): received routine medical treatment (bisphosphonates, calcium, and vitamin D) in addition to pulsed magnetic therapy on the hip region for 12 weeks (3 sessions/week). Group B (exercise group): received routine medical treatment plus moderate-intensity aerobic exercise for 12 weeks (3 sessions/week). Group C (combined magnetic therapy and exercise therapy group): received routine medical treatment plus pulsed magnetic therapy and moderate-intensity aerobic exercise for 12 weeks (3 sessions/week). The 3 groups were assessed for bone mineral density (BMD) at baseline by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry and after 12 weeks of treatment. The results showed that within-group analysis a statistically significant increase was reveled (P < .05) for BMD in the 3 studied groups.

For patients starting on 50 mg, increasing to 100 or 200 mg provided a positive efficacy-TEAE balance, despite an increase in incidence of ≥1 MC-TEAE. For patients starting on 100 mg, increasing to 200 mg provided a positive efficacy-TEAE balance. If the initial dose was 100 or 200 mg, the incidence of patients experiencing ≥1 MC-TEAE decreased or stayed the same with their subsequent dose, regardless of dose. Decreasing from 200 to 100 mg led to a decrease in patients with pain freedom and ≥1 MC-TEAE, resulting in a neutral efficacy-TEAE balance. Shift analyses supported these findings.Conclusion: A positive efficacy-TEAE balance exists for patients increasing their lasmiditan dose for treatment of a subsequent migraine attack. These results could be important for optimizing dosing for individual patients.Clinicaltrials.gov: SAMURAI (NCT02439320); SPARTAN (NCT02605174); GLADIATOR (NCT02565186).", "labels": [[64, 86, "Patient"], [12, 37, "Intervention"], [41, 60, "Outcome"], [854, 1011, "Outcome"], [2147, 2279, "TOREMOVE"], [647, 852, "Intervention"]]}

The transfusion rate in hysterectomies for benign pathology is almost 3%. However, despite the strong interest in reducing intraoperative bleeding, limited evidence is available regarding the technical aspects concerning uterine vessel management during a total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH). Uterine artery (UA) closure in TLH can be performed at the origin from the internal iliac artery or at the uterus level (UL). However, low-quality evidence is available regarding the superiority of one method over the other. We performed a single-blind randomized (1:1) controlled trial (NCT04156932) between December 2019 and August 2020. One hundred and eighty women undergoing TLH for benign gynecological diseases were randomized to TLH with UA closure at the origin from the internal iliac artery (n = 90), performed at the beginning of the procedure by putting two clips per side at the origin, vs closure at the UL (n = 90). Intraoperative blood loss estimated from suction devices was the primary outcome. Secondary end points were perioperative outcomes, the conversion rate from one technique to the other, and complication rates with 4 months of follow up. Uterine artery closure at the origin was completed in all 90 patients (0%), whereas closure at the UL was converted to closure at the origin in 11 cases (12.2%; p < 0.001); failures were mainly associated with the presence of endometriosis (81.8% [9/11] vs 10.1% [8/79]; p < 0.001). In the intention-to-treat analysis, the intraoperative blood loss was higher in the group assigned to the closure at the UL (108.5 mL) than in the group with closure at the origin (69.3 mL); the mean difference was 39.2 mL (95% CI 13.47-64.93 mL; p = 0.003).

Anti-tuberculous therapy (ATT) alone cannot easily cure spine tuberculosis (STB) though it is the most essential treatment. Many studies have confirmed the efficacy of the surgical treatment of STB through anterior, anterolateral, posterior debridement, and intervertebral fusion or combined with internal fixation. However, the conventional surgical approach requires extensive exposure of the affected areas with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Recently, minimally invasive surgery has come into use to reduce iatrogenic trauma and relevant complications. Here, we introduced a novel technique for the treatment of thoracic and lumbar spine tuberculosis: minimally invasive far lateral debridement and posterior instrumentation (MI-FLDPI). In this study, we evaluated the technical feasibility, the clinical outcomes, and the postoperative complications. We did a prospective, non-randomized study on this new technique. Twenty three patients (13 males) with thoracic or lumbar spine tuberculosis who underwent minimally invasive far lateral debridement and posterior instrumentation were included in the study. The preoperative comorbidities, operation duration, intra-operative hemorrhage, Cobb's angles, and postoperative complications were recorded and analyzed. Clinical outcomes were evaluated by Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), neurological recovery, and eradication of tuberculosis. Radiological outcomes were evaluated by changes in Cobb's angle and fusion status of the affected segments. The patients were followed for an average of 19 months (ranging from 12 to 36 months). At the final follow-up, CRP and ESR of all patients were normal. The VAS and ODI were significantly improved compared with preoperative values (P < 0.05). No evident progression of the kyphotic deformity was found after surgery. Twenty two patients showed spontaneous peripheral interbody fusion 1 year after surgery. There were no failure of the instrumentation even though a young female with drug-resistant tuberculosis showed no sign of interbody fusion at the third year follow-up. All the patients with preoperative neurological deficit showed complete recovery at the final follow-up.

{"id": "34637450", "text": "Behavioural activation to prevent depression and loneliness among socially isolated older people with long-term conditions: The BASIL COVID-19 pilot randomised controlled trial. Older adults, including those with long-term conditions (LTCs), are vulnerable to social isolation. They are likely to have become more socially isolated during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, often due to advice to shield to protect them from infection. This places them at particular risk of depression and loneliness. There is a need for brief scalable psychosocial interventions to mitigate the psychological impacts of social isolation. Behavioural activation (BA) is a credible candidate intervention, but a trial is needed. We undertook an external pilot parallel randomised trial (ISRCTN94091479) designed to test recruitment, retention and engagement with, and the acceptability and preliminary effects of the intervention. Participants aged ≥65 years with 2 or more LTCs were recruited in primary care and randomised by computer and with concealed allocation between June and October 2020. BA was offered to intervention participants (n = 47), and control participants received usual primary care (n = 49). Assessment of outcome was made blind to treatment allocation. The primary outcome was depression severity (measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9)). We also measured health-related quality of life (measured by the Short Form (SF)-12v2 mental component scale (MCS) and physical component scale (PCS)), anxiety (measured by the Generalised Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7)), perceived social and emotional loneliness (measured by the De Jong Gierveld Scale: 11-item loneliness scale). Outcome was measured at 1 and 3 months. The mean age of participants was aged 74 years (standard deviation (SD) 5.5) and they were mostly White (n = 92, 95.8%), and approximately two-thirds of the sample were female (n = 59, 61.5%). Remote recruitment was possible, and 45/47 (95.7%) randomised to the intervention completed 1 or more sessions (median 6 sessions) out of 8. A total of 90 (93.8%) completed the 1-month follow-up, and 86 (89.6%) completed the 3-month follow-up, with similar rates for control (1 month: 45/49 and 3 months 44/49) and intervention (1 month: 45/47and 3 months: 42/47) follow-up. Between-group comparisons were made using a confidence interval (CI) approach, and by adjusting for the covariate of interest at baseline. At 1 month (the primary clinical outcome point), the median number of completed sessions for people receiving the BA intervention was 3, and almost all participants were still receiving the BA intervention. The between-group comparison for the primary clinical outcome at 1 month was an adjusted between-group mean difference of -0.50 PHQ-9 points (95% CI -2.01 to 1.01), but only a small number of participants had completed the intervention at this point. At 3 months, the PHQ-9 adjusted mean difference (AMD) was 0.19 (95% CI -1.36 to 1.75). When we examined loneliness, the adjusted between-group difference in the De Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale at 1 month was 0.28 (95% CI -0.51 to 1.06) and at 3 months -0.87 (95% CI -1.56 to -0.18), suggesting evidence of benefit of the intervention at this time point. For anxiety, the GAD adjusted between-group difference at 1 month was 0.20 (-1.33, 1.73) and at 3 months 0.31 (-1.08, 1.70). For the SF-12 (physical component score), the adjusted between-group difference at 1 month was 0.34 (-4.17, 4.85) and at 3 months 0.11 (-4.46, 4.67). For the SF-12 (mental component score), the adjusted between-group difference at 1 month was 1.91 (-2.64, 5.15) and at 3 months 1.26 (-2.64, 5.15). Participants who withdrew had minimal depressive symptoms at entry. There were no adverse events. The Behavioural Activation in Social Isolation (BASIL) study had 2 main limitations. First, we found that the intervention was still being delivered at the prespecified primary outcome point, and this fed into the design of the main trial where a primary outcome of 3 months is now collected. Second, this was a pilot trial and was not designed to test between-group differences with high levels of statistical power. Type 2 errors are likely to have occurred, and a larger trial is now underway to test for robust effects and replicate signals of effectiveness in important secondary outcomes such as loneliness. In this study, we observed that BA is a credible intervention to mitigate the psychological impacts of COVID-19 isolation for older adults. We demonstrated that it is feasible to undertake a trial of BA. The intervention can be delivered remotely and at scale, but should be reserved for older adults with evidence of depressive symptoms.

In this single-arm phase II trial, patients with metastatic breast cancer received veliparib 30 to 40 mg twice daily on days 1 to 7 with concurrent temozolomide 150 mg/m 2  on days 1 to 5 of a 28-day cycle. The primary cohort was unselected for BRCA mutation status, and an expansion cohort enrolled only BRCA1/2 carriers. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) in each cohort. Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), clinical benefit rate (CBR), and evaluation of safety and tolerability. In the primary cohort of 41 unselected patients, which included 9 BRCA mutation carriers, the ORR was 10% and clinical benefit rate at 4 months (CBR) was 27%. In the expansion cohort of 21 BRCA1/2 carriers, the ORR was 14% and CBR was 43%. Among all 30 BRCA1/2 carriers, the ORR was 23% versus 0% among non-carriers. In the subset of BRCA1/2 carriers, the ORR was 32% among platinum-naïve patients versus 9% among platinum-exposed patients. The median PFS was 3.3 months among BRCA1/2 carriers compared to 1.8 months among non-carriers (HR: 0.48, p = 0.006). A longer median PFS of 6.2 months was observed among BRCA1/2 carriers who had no prior platinum therapy. The most common grade 3 and 4 toxicities were thrombocytopenia (32%) and neutropenia (21%) that generally improved with dose modifications. Veliparib and temozolomide demonstrated clinical activity in platinum-naïve BRCA-associated metastatic breast cancer with manageable toxicity at doses of veliparib well below the single-agent active dose.

Data were obtained from a large randomised controlled trial comparing mobile teledermoscopy-enhanced skin self-examinations (SSEs) with naked-eye SSE. A semi-structured interview guide was developed by the investigators with questions focusing on people's previous skin screening behaviours and 2 of the major pathways which can be utilised in mobile teledermoscopy: (i) direct-to-consumer and (ii) doctor-to-doctor. All interviews were tape-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Thematic analysis was undertaken by 2 independent researchers. Twenty-eight participants were interviewed. Eighty-six percent of participants (n = 24/28) had previously had a clinical skin examination. Only 18% of participants (n = 5/28) visited the same doctor for each clinical skin examination. Five main themes were identified in the interviews that affected how people felt about the integration of mobile teledermoscopy into skin screening pathways: history of clinical skin examinations, continuity of the doctor-patient relationship, convenience of the direct-to-consumer teledermoscopy, expedited review enhancing the doctor-to-doctor setting and mobile teledermoscopy as a partner-assisted task. Overall mobile teledermoscopy was viewed positively for both direct-to-consumer and doctor-to-doctor interaction.

The preliminary report of the RECOVERY large randomised controlled trial indicated a promising survival effect for dexamethasone therapy of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This study aimed to investigate the anti-hypoxic activities of dexamethasone to understand a possible mechanism of its action in hypoxia-induced lethality through experimental models of hypoxia. In this investigation, 84 Male BALB/c mice were randomly divided into groups of seven (12 groups). Treatment groups received 10 days of dexamethasone intraperitoneal injection at both human dose (~0.1 mg/kg) and the animal does (~1 mg/kg). Control negative and positive groups were treated with 10 ml/kg of normal saline and 30 mg/kg of propranolol, respectively. Three experimental models of hypoxia, asphyctic, circulatory, and hemic were applied in this study. The findings showed that dexamethasone significantly prolonged the latency for death in the asphyctic model concerning the control group in both humans (P < .0001) and animal dose (P < .0001). The results were also highly significant for both doses in the hemic model (P < .001). In the circulatory model, although a small increase was observed in death prolongation, results were not statistically significant for both doses in this model (P > .05). This experimental in vivo investigation demonstrated an excellent protective effect for 10 days of dexamethasone treatment against hypoxia, especially in asphyctic and hemic models. In addition to promising dexamethasone outcomes, using propranolol as the positive control illustrated a very substantial anti-hypoxic effect even much better than dexamethasone in all models.

In this preliminary report, we aim to describe the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of adult critically ill COVID-19 patients, requiring invasive mechanical ventilation (iMV), and receiving IL-6RA and steroids therapy over the last 11 months. International, multicenter, cohort study derived from Viral Infection and Respiratory Illness University Study registry and conducted through Discovery Network, Society of Critical Care Medicine. Data were collected between March 01, 2020, and January 10, 2021. Of 860 patients who met eligibility criteria, 589 received steroids, 170 IL-6RAs, and 101 combinations. Patients who received IL-6RAs were younger (median age of 57.5 years vs. 61.1 and 61.8 years in the steroids and combination groups, respectively). The median C-reactive protein level was > 75 mg/L, indicating a hyperinflammatory phenotype. The median daily steroid dose was 7.5 mg dexamethasone or equivalent (interquartile range: 6-14 mg); 80.8% and 19.2% received low-dose and high-dose steroids, respectively. Of the patients who received IL-6RAs, the majority received one dose of tocilizumab and sarilumab (dose range of 600-800 mg for tocilizumab and 200-400 mg for sarilumab). Regarding the timing of administration, we observed that steroid and IL-6RA administration on day 0 of ICU admission was only 55.6% and 39.5%, respectively. By day 28, when compared with steroid use alone, IL-6RA use was associated with an adjusted incidence rate ratio (aIRR) of 1.12 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.88, 1.4) for ventilator-free days, while combination therapy was associated with an aIRR of 0.83 (95% CI 0.6, 1.14). IL-6RA use was associated with an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of 0.68 (95% CI 0.44, 1.07) for the 28-day mortality rate, while combination therapy was associated with an aOR of 1.07 (95% CI 0.67, 1.70).

Vaccination with SARS-CoV-2 sclamp elicited a similar antigen-specific response irrespective of dose: 4 weeks after the initial dose (day 29) with 5 μg dose (geometric mean titre [GMT] 6400, 95% CI 3683-11 122), with 15 μg dose (7492, 4959-11 319), and the two 45 μg dose cohorts (8770, 5526-13 920 in the two-dose 45 μg cohort; 8793, 5570-13 881 in the single-dose 45 μg cohort); 4 weeks after the second dose (day 57) with two 5 μg doses (102 400, 64 857-161 676), with two 15 μg doses (74 725, 51 300-108 847), with two 45 μg doses (79 586, 55 430-114 268), only a single 45 μg dose (4795, 2858-8043). At day 57, 67 (99%) of 68 participants who received two doses of sclamp vaccine at any concentration produced a neutralising immune response, compared with six (25%) of 24 who received a single 45 μg dose and none of 22 who received placebo. Participants receiving two doses of sclamp vaccine elicited similar neutralisation titres, irrespective of dose: two 5 μg doses (GMT 228, 95% CI 146-356), two 15 μg doses (230, 170-312), and two 45 μg doses (239, 187-307). This first-in-human trial shows that a subunit vaccine comprising mammalian cell culture-derived, MF59-adjuvanted, molecular clamp-stabilised recombinant spike protein elicits strong immune responses with a promising safety profile. However, the glycoprotein 41 peptide present in the clamp created HIV diagnostic assay interference, a possible barrier to widespread use highlighting the criticality of potential non-spike directed immunogenicity during vaccine development.

The total number of 128 individuals were enrolled in the study. The 35 did not meet the inclusion criteria due to malignancy signs and presence of diabetes mellitus. In total, 8 were lost to follow-up, and 10 were excluded from the analysis, due to analgesics intake. This way 75 patients with the erosive form of OLP were analyzed in three intervention groups (Er:YAG, n = 19; Nd:YAG, n = 15; Er:YAG + Nd:YAG combination, n = 20) and one control group with scalpel excision (n = 21). The therapy effectiveness has been assessed based on the comparison of salivary interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 and interferon (IFN)-γ preoperative levels to 14, 30 days, and 2 years postoperation, as well as pain level and time of epithelization. All HLLT groups demonstrated a significantly (p > 0.05) higher IL-1β, IL-6, IFNγ and pain level reduction and quicker epithelization toward the control group on the 30th day, except Nd:YAG in case of IFNγ level. The highest IL-1β, IFNγ and pain level reduction and quicker epithelization on the 30th day was observed in Er:YAG group, followed by Er:YAG + Nd:YAG combination, Nd:YAG respectively. However no significant difference was observed between the HLLT groups with regard to IL-6 level reduction. After a 2-year follow-up, no significant difference was observed between all study groups with regard to all variables. HLLT yields a superior clinical outcome compared to the scalpel excision for the surgical treatment of oral lichen planus, whereby the Er:YAG has been proposed as the most effective laser type at the end of the first postoperative month.

This study evaluates the effectiveness of a clinician guided, pedometer-driven, walking intervention for increasing physical activity and improving clinical outcomes compared to education and advice. Randomized controlled trial recruiting N = 174 adults with CLBP. Participants were randomly allocated into either a standardized care group (SG) or pedometer based walking group (WG) using minimization allocation with a 2:1 ratio to the WG. Prior to randomization all participants were given a standard package of education and advice regarding self-management and the benefits of staying active. Following randomization the WG undertook a physiotherapist guided pedometer-driven walking program for 12 weeks. This was individually tailored by weekly negotiation of daily step targets. Main outcome was the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) recorded at baseline, 12 weeks, 6 and 12 months. Other outcomes included, numeric pain rating, International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), Fear-Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire (FABQ), Back Beliefs questionnaire (BBQ), Physical Activity Self-efficacy Scale, and EQ-5D-5L quality of life estimate.

Men with HIV were almost twice as likely as women with HIV to have CD4 ≤ 350/uL and be untreated (15% vs 8%, respectively). Streamlined care reduced mortality by 28% versus control (risk ratio [RR] = 0.72; 95% confidence interval [CI]: .56, .93; P = .02). Despite eligibility in both arms, persons with CD4 ≤ 350/uL started ART faster under streamlined care versus control (76% vs 43% by 12 months, respectively; P < .001). Mortality was reduced substantially more among men (RR = 0.61; 95% CI: .43, .86; P = .01) than among women (RR = 0.90; 95% CI: .62, 1.32; P = .58). After population-based HIV testing, streamlined care reduced population-level mortality among persons with HIV and CD4 ≤ 350/uL, particularly among men.

To assess clinical changes after intraductal MG probing for patients with refractory obstructive meibomian gland dysfunction. Randomized, double-masked, sham-controlled clinical trial. Single-center, tertiary referral center. 42 patients with refractory obstructive MGD associated with lid tenderness. Enrolled patients received one of the following treatments: 1) MG probing plus post-procedural topical sulfacetamide/prednisolone ointment (Blephamide®), 2) MG probing plus post-procedural lubricating ointment (GenTeal), or 3) sham probing plus GenTeal ointment. The probing was performed on the upper lids of both eyes. Primary outcome measures were symptoms as measured by Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) and Symptom Assessment iN Dry Eye (SANDE), as well as tear break-up time (TBUT). Secondary outcome measures were other clinical signs. Safety of the procedure was also evaluated by investigating the treatment-related adverse events. At baseline and 4 weeks after the procedure a masked observer evaluated the following outcome measures: symptom questionnaires, including OSDI and SANDE, upper lid tenderness, lid margin telangiectasia, corneal fluorescein staining, conjunctival lissamine green staining, TBUT, Schirmer's test, and meibomian glands yielding liquid secretion (MGYLS). Compared to baseline, the MG probing/Blephamide® group showed significant improvements in both OSDI and SANDE scores and the MG probing/GenTeal group demonstrated a significant improvement only in SANDE score. In contrast, the Sham/GenTeal group did not show any statistically significant changes in symptoms. There were no statistically significant changes in clinical signs in any group at the 4-week visit, except for improvement of lid tenderness in the sham probing group.

A prospective, randomized, controlled, non-blind, non-placebo study was performed in a single center.A total of 105 patients who underwent surgery with JJ stent (PNL, URS, pyeloplasty, UNC) were randomized into two groups. 53 patients in Group A received CAP and 52 patients in Group B were controlled without CAP, during the presence of a JJ stent. Patients with external stents, nephrostomy tubes, indwelling long-term urethral catheters were excluded. History of preoperative use of CAP and lower urinary tract symptoms were noted. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) was used as the initial choice of antibiotic however if there was a history of antibiotic resistance in previous urinary cultures, Nitrofurantoin was administrated. Urinary cultures were obtained before surgery and before stent extraction. JJ stents were sent to culture. Symptomatic febrile urinary tract infections with positive urine cultures (10 5  CFU on a clean catch or 10 3 with urethral catheterization) were compared between groups. Our study has some limitations; the study is the single-center, we did not follow-up of patients in terms of scar, there were low number of uncircumcised patients, multiple types of surgical procedures were performed. JJ stent is a frequently used instrument in children. Unfortunately, any randomized prospective on antibiotics administration while using a JJ stent is not available in the current literature. We hope our research will contribute to the existing literature and cause a significant change in clinical practice. The mean age among all patients was 4.8 ± 3.9 years.

{"id": 153, "text": "Symptoms associated with influenza vaccination and experimental human pneumococcal colonisation of the nasopharynx. Nasopharyngeal colonisation by S. pneumoniae is a prerequisite for invasive pneumococcal infections. Influenza co-infection leads to increased susceptibility to secondary pneumonia and mortality during influenza epidemics. Increased bacterial load and impaired immune responses to pneumococcus caused by influenza play a role in this increased susceptibility. Using an Experimental Human Challenge Model and influenza vaccines, we examined symptoms experienced by healthy adults during nasal co-infection with S. pneumoniae and live attenuated influenza virus. Randomised, blinded administration of Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV) or Tetravalent Inactivated Influenza Vaccine (TIV) either preceded bacterial inoculation or followed it, separated by a 3-day interval. The presence and density of S. pneumoniae was determined from nasal washes. Participants completed a symptom questionnaire from the first intervention until 6 days post second intervention. The timing and type of influenza vaccination and presence of S. pneumoniae in the nasopharynx significantly affected symptom reporting. In the study where influenza vaccination preceded bacterial inoculation: nasal symptoms were less common in the LAIV group than the TIV group (OR 0.57, p < 0.01); with colonisation status only affecting the TIV group where more symptoms were reported by colonised participants compared to non-colonised participants following inoculation (n = 12/23 [52.17%] vs n = 13/38 [34.21%], respectively; p < 0.05).

S44819, a selective GABAA α5 receptor antagonist, reduces tonic post-ischaemic inhibition of the peri-infarct cortex. S44819 improved stroke recovery in rodents and increased cortical excitability in a transcranial magnetic stimulation study in healthy volunteers. The Randomized Efficacy and Safety Trial of Oral GABAA α5 antagonist S44819 after Recent ischemic Event (RESTORE BRAIN) aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of S44819 for enhancing clinical recovery of patients with ischaemic stroke. RESTORE BRAIN was an international, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, multicentre phase 2 trial that evaluated the safety and efficacy of oral S44189 in patients with recent ischaemic stroke. The study was done in specialised stroke units in 92 actively recruiting centres in 14 countries: ten were European countries (Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Spain, and the UK) and four were non-European countries (Australia, Brazil, Canada, and South Korea). Patients aged 18-85 years with acute ischaemic stroke involving cerebral cortex (National Institute of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS] score 7-20) without previous disability were eligible for inclusion. Participants were randomly assigned to receive 150 mg S44819 twice a day, 300 mg S44819 twice a day, or placebo twice a day by a balanced, non-adaptive randomisation method with a 1:1:1 ratio. Treatment randomisation and allocation were centralised via the interactive web response system using computer-generated random sequences with a block size of 3. Blinding of treatment was achieved by identical appearance and taste of all sachets. Patients, investigators and individuals involved in the analysis of the trial were masked to group assignment. The primary endpoint was the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score 90 days from onset of treatment, evaluated by shift analysis (predefined main analysis) or by dichotomised analyses using 0-1 versus 2-6 and 0-2 versus 3-6 cutoffs (predefined secondary analysis). Secondary endpoints were the effects of S44819 on the NIHSS and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores, time needed to complete parts A and B of the Trail Making Test, and the Barthel index. Efficacy analyses were done on all patients who received at least one dose of treatment and had at least one mRS score taken after day 5 (specifically, on or after day 30). Safety was compared across treatment groups for all patients who received at least one dose of treatment. The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02877615.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a zoonotic RNA virus characterized by high transmission rates and pathogenicity worldwide. Continued control of the COVID-19 pandemic requires the diversification of rapid, easy to use, sensitive, and portable methods for SARS-CoV-2 sample preparation and analysis. Here, we propose a method for SARS-CoV-2 viral enrichment and enzymatic extraction of RNA from clinically relevant matrices in under 10 min. This technique utilizes affinity-capture hydrogel particles to concentrate SARS-CoV-2 from solution, and leverages existing PDQeX technology for RNA isolation. Characterization of our method is accomplished with reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for relative, comparative RNA detection. In a double-blind study analyzing viral transport media (VTM) obtained from clinical nasopharyngeal swabs, our sample preparation method demonstrated both comparable results to a routinely used commercial extraction kit and 100% concordance with laboratory diagnoses. Compatibility of eluates with alternative forms of analysis was confirmed using microfluidic RT-PCR (μRT-PCR), recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP). The alternative methods explored here conveyed successful amplification from all RNA eluates originating from positive clinical samples.

Treatment switching adjustment methods are often used to adjust for switching in oncology randomized controlled trials (RCTs). In this exploratory analysis, we apply these methods to adjust for treatment changes in the setting of an RCT followed by an extension study in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. The CLARITY trial evaluated cladribine tablets versus placebo over 96 weeks. In the 96-week CLARITY Extension, patients who received placebo in CLARITY received cladribine tablets; patients who received cladribine tablets in CLARITY were re-randomized to placebo or cladribine tablets. End points were time to first qualifying relapse (FQR) and time to 3- and 6-month confirmed disability progression (3mCDP, 6mCDP). We aimed to compare the effectiveness of cladribine tablets with placebo over CLARITY and the extension. The rank-preserving structural failure time model (RPSFTM) and iterative parameter estimation (IPE) were used to estimate what would have happened if patients had received placebo in CLARITY and the extension versus patients that received cladribine tablets and switched to placebo. To gauge whether treatment effect waned after the 96 weeks of CLARITY, we compared hazard ratios (HRs) from the adjustment analysis with HRs from CLARITY. The RPSFTM resulted in an HR of 0.48 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.36-0.62] for FQR, 0.62 (95% CI 0.46-0.84) for 3mCDP and 0.62 (95% CI 0.44-0.88) for 6mCDP. IPE algorithm results were similar.

The aim of this study was to compare effects of dietary Flavonol consumption in white tea, with or without aerobic training, among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus as a randomized trial. 49 women with T2D were randomly assigned into groups including control, white tea, aerobic training, and aerobic training + white tea. The interventions were carried out for six months. Weight, Body Mass Index (BMI), body Fat, peak oxygen consumption (VO2Max), and Blood Pressure were evaluated at both the first and last days of the research period. Blood samples were withdrawn on the same days via venipuncture to test blood glucose, insulin, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), cholesterol, and triglycerides (T.G.). Characteristics analysis showed significant improvements in treated groups. In addition, glucose, insulin, LDL, Cholesterol, and T.G. were significantly reduced while HDL was remarkably increased in treated groups compared to pre-experiment values or the diabetic control group. Collectively, white tea combined with aerobic training favorably affects glycemic parameters, lipid profile, blood pressure, and VO2Max in six months in women with T2D.

The optimal duration of DAPT in ACS patients treated with DES is still unclear. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to investigate a short versus a standard 12-month DAPT regimen in ACS patients undergoing new-generation DES implantation. REDUCE was a prospective, open-label, multicentre, investigator-initiated study that randomised 1,496 ACS patients after treatment with the COMBO stent to either three (n=751) or 12 months (n=745) of DAPT. The primary study endpoint was a composite of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis, stroke, target vessel revascularisation and bleeding at 12 months. No difference was observed in the demographic and clinical characteristics between the two groups, except for gender (p=0.01). At one-year follow-up, non-inferiority of three- versus 12-month DAPT in the primary endpoint was met (8.2% vs 8.4%, pnon-inferiority<0.001). The similar outcome between the two groups was confirmed at two-year follow-up (11.6% vs 12.1%, p=0.76), with no significant difference in overall mortality (3.1% vs 2.2%, p=0.27), cardiac mortality (1.8% vs 1.1%, p=0.28), stent thrombosis (1.6% vs 0.8%, p=0.16) and major bleeding (3.3% vs 4.0%, p=0.46). The results show that, among ACS patients treated with the COMBO stent, three months is non-inferior to 12 months of DAPT. However, given the numerically higher rates of mortality and ST in the three-month DAPT group, one-year DAPT should still be recommended in ACS until more information becomes available. A three-month DAPT strategy should be considered only if clinically mandated.", "labels": [[46, 82, "Intervention"], [86, 174, "Patient"], [317, 322, "Intervention"], [332, 362, "Control"], [366, 421, "Patient"], [525, 574, "Patient"], [584, 590, "Intervention"], [602, 611, "Control"], [662, 802, "Outcome"], [1502, 1687, "TOREMOVE"]]}

This study aimed to assess the predictive ability of the Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) risk score 2.0 in contemporary acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients, and its relation to antiplatelet strategies. The predictive value of the GRACE risk score in the contemporary ACS cohort and the appropriate antiplatelet regimen according to the risk remain unclear. This is a subgroup analysis of the all-comers, randomized GLOBAL LEADERS trial, comparing ticagrelor monotherapy versus conventional dual-antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The GRACE risk score 2.0 with 1-year mortality prediction was implemented. The randomized antiplatelet effect was assessed in predefined three GRACE risk-groups; low-risk (GRACE <109), moderate-risk (GRACE 109-140), and high-risk (GRACE >140). The GRACE risk score was available in 6,594 out of 7,487 ACS patients among whom 1,743, 2,823, and 2,028 patients were classified as low-risk, moderate-risk, and high-risk, respectively. At 1 year, all-cause mortality occurred in 120 patients (1.8%). The discrimination ability of the GRACE model was moderate (C-statistic = 0.742), whereas 1-year mortality risk was overestimated (mean predicted mortality rate: 3.9%; the Hosmer-Lemeshow chi-square: 21.47; p = 0.006). There were no significant interactions between the GRACE risk strata and effects of the ticagrelor monotherapy on ischemic or bleeding outcomes at 1 year compared to the reference strategy. The GRACE risk score 2.0 is valuable in discriminating high risk ACS patients, however, the recalibration of the score is recommended for better risk stratification.

{"id": 404, "text": "Dermatological side effects of targeted antineoplastic therapies: a prospective study. Epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors (EGFRs) are chemotherapeutic agents used in multiple solid organ malignity. These medications have common dermatological side effects, particularly papulopustular (PPL) lesions. The management of the diagnosis and treatment processes for such side effects may facilitate the continuation of chemotherapy and enhance the patient's quality of life. The objective of this study is to report the cutaneous side effects of EGFR inhibitors and to share treatment methods for such side effects. In this prospective study, 59 patients using EGFR due to breast and colorectal carcinoma at the oncology unit of Haseki Training and Research Hospital were assessed. The patients for whom EGFR was initiated were examined at the beginning of the treatment at weeks 1 and 2, their demographic characteristics were recorded, and the patients who developed a skin rash were followed up from the onset of the lesion. The PPL side effects that developed in the patients and other dermatological findings were recorded. The PPL side effects were graded, and the treatment plans were reported. The study was conducted between February 2016 and February 2018 under the approval of the local ethical committee. The mean age of the 59 patients (47 females, 12 males) taking EGFR inhibitors was 52.4 ± 12.0 (range: 29-84). Forty-five patients had early stage and 14 patients had advanced stage carcinoma. Fourteen patients had colorectal carcinoma, three patients had renal cancer, and 42 patients had breast cancer. Forty-two patients were using trastuzumab (single therapy in 29 patients and combined therapy in 13 patients), five patients were using cetuximab, three patients were using sunitinib, eight patients were using panitumumab, and six patients were using pertuzumab. In 22 patients, PPL side effects were observed in the skin; it was G1 in 19 patients and G2 in three patients. In seven patients who developed acneiform side effects, systemic doxycycline was used, and in others, topical tetracycline and clindamycin were used. Except for one patient using trastuzumab, all patients has lesions on the face, upper trunk, and back. One patient exhibited an atypical rash, which was diagnosed as a granulomatous follicular reaction. Xerosis was present in two cases, and paronychia, pyogenic granuloma, trichomegaly, and madarosis were observed in one patient each. The patients who developed an acneiform rash were treated with topical and systemic antibiotics, light keratolytics, and emollients. The skin side effects of all patients were mild to moderate, and all patients completed the chemotherapy process. An acneiform skin rash and other dermatological side effects are common with EGFR inhibitors. To treat these side effects, emollients, topical steroids, and local, systemic antibiotics are recommended.

Ruxolitinib, a potent Janus kinase 1/2 inhibitor, has demonstrated durable improvements in patients with myelofibrosis. In this analysis of the Phase 3b JUMP study, which included patients aged ≥18 years with a diagnosis of primary or secondary myelofibrosis, we assessed the safety and efficacy of ruxolitinib in patients stratified by Dynamic International Prognostic Scoring System (DIPSS) risk categories. Baseline characteristic data were available to assess DIPSS status for 1844 of the 2233 enrolled patients; 60, 835, 755, and 194 in the low-, intermediate (Int)-1-, Int-2-, and high-risk groups, respectively. Ruxolitinib was generally well tolerated across all risk groups, with an adverse-event (AE) profile consistent with previous reports. The most common hematologic AEs were thrombocytopenia and anemia, with highest rates of Grade ≥3 events in high-risk patients. Approximately, 73% of patients experienced ≥50% reductions in palpable spleen length at any point in the ≤24-month treatment period, with highest rates in lower-risk categories (low, 82.1%; Int-1, 79.3%; Int-2, 67.1%; high risk, 61.6%). Median time to spleen length reduction was 5.1 weeks and was shortest in lower-risk patients. Across measures, 40%-57% of patients showed clinically meaningful symptom improvements, which were observed from 4 weeks after treatment initiation and maintained throughout the study. Overall survival (OS) was 92% at Week 72 and 75% at Week 240 (4.6 years). Median OS was longer for Int-2-risk than high-risk patients (253.6 vs. 147.3 weeks), but not evaluable in low-/Int-1-risk patients. By Week 240, progression-free survival (PFS) and leukemia-free survival (LFS) rates were higher in lower-risk patients (PFS: low, 90%; Int-1, 82%; Int-2, 46%; high risk, 15%; LFS: low, 92%; Int-1, 86%; Int-2, 58%; high risk, 19%).
