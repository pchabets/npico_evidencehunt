The low quality of life in heart failure patients is related to low self-care and treatment adherence. Consequently, innovative strategies are needed to improve them. The objective of this work is to determine the effectiveness of the use of a home telemonitoring system to improve the self-care and treatment adherence of heart failure patients. A randomized clinical trial that compares the efficacy of a home telemonitoring system -intervention group versus usual care control group - among heart failure outpatients over a 90-day monitoring period was carried out. The home telemonitoring system consists of an application that collects measurements of different parameters on a daily basis and provides health education to patients. The home telemonitoring system processes data gathered and generates an alert if a risky situation arises. The outcomes observed were significant changes in patients' self-care (European Heart Failure Self-care Behaviour Scale), treatment adherence (Morisky Modified Scale) and re-hospitalizations over the follow-up period. 104 heart failure patients were screened; 40 met the inclusion criteria; only 30 completed the study. After the follow-up, intragroup analysis of the control group indicated a decrease in treatment adherence (p = 0.02). The mean European Heart Failure Self-care Behaviour Scale overall score indicated an improved self-care in the intervention group patients (p = 0.03) and a worsened self-care in the control group (p = 0.04) with a p value of 0.004 in the intergroup analysis. Thanks to the home telemonitoring system alerts, two re-hospitalizations were avoided. This study demonstrated that the proposed home telemonitoring system improves patient self-care when compared to usual care and has the potential to avoid re-hospitalizations, even considering patients with low literacy levels.Trial Registration: Home Telemonitoring System for Patients with Heart Failure. clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT04071093.", "labels": [[44, 66, "Patient"], [420, 442, "Patient"], [504, 544, "Intervention"], [558, 576, "Control"], [670, 833, "Intervention"], [835, 940, "Intervention"], [1726, 1953, "B"], [0, 39, "Intervention"], [311, 324, "Outcome"], [332, 367, "Intervention"], [371, 416, "Outcome"], [490, 498, "Outcome"], [591, 616, "Patient"], [969, 1158, "Outcome"]]}

Peripherally inserted central venous catheters (PICCs) are increasingly used for parenteral access in critically ill hospitalized patients, but they increase the incidence of upper extremity deep venous thrombosis (UE DVT). Sequential compression devices (SCDs) applied to the legs effectively reduce lower extremity DVT, but have not been tested in the arms. Our objective was to determine whether SCDs applied to the arm may reduce the risk of PICC-associated UE DVT. This was a retrospective study of randomized, single-center, controlled clinical trial on patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit with critical neurological illness who had a PICC and were not receiving anticoagulants. Between January 2014 and October 2016, patients were randomized 1:1 to an intervention group having a custom SCD applied to the arm harboring the PICC or to a control group. The primary endpoint was ultrasound-detected UE DVT. Following randomization of 77 subjects, the study was terminated due to excess DVT in the treatment arm. UE DVT was detected in 18 subjects (29.0%), and it was more frequent among those in the SCD group (13/31 [41.9%] vs. the control group 5/31 [16.1%]; p = 0.049). After accounting for crossovers, the difference was still significant (12/28 [43.0%] vs. 6/34 [17.6%]; p = 0.048). Yet, symptomatic UE DVT (n = 3) and pulmonary embolism without evidence of lower extremity DVT (n = 2) were only observed in patients who were not wearing the SCD on the arm. Although UE DVT is commonly associated with PICC use, the results of this trial do not support the use of SCD on the arm for DVT prevention.

Treatment switching adjustment methods are often used to adjust for switching in oncology randomized controlled trials (RCTs). In this exploratory analysis, we apply these methods to adjust for treatment changes in the setting of an RCT followed by an extension study in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. The CLARITY trial evaluated cladribine tablets versus placebo over 96 weeks. In the 96-week CLARITY Extension, patients who received placebo in CLARITY received cladribine tablets; patients who received cladribine tablets in CLARITY were re-randomized to placebo or cladribine tablets. End points were time to first qualifying relapse (FQR) and time to 3- and 6-month confirmed disability progression (3mCDP, 6mCDP). We aimed to compare the effectiveness of cladribine tablets with placebo over CLARITY and the extension. The rank-preserving structural failure time model (RPSFTM) and iterative parameter estimation (IPE) were used to estimate what would have happened if patients had received placebo in CLARITY and the extension versus patients that received cladribine tablets and switched to placebo. To gauge whether treatment effect waned after the 96 weeks of CLARITY, we compared hazard ratios (HRs) from the adjustment analysis with HRs from CLARITY. The RPSFTM resulted in an HR of 0.48 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.36-0.62] for FQR, 0.62 (95% CI 0.46-0.84) for 3mCDP and 0.62 (95% CI 0.44-0.88) for 6mCDP. IPE algorithm results were similar.

This study aimed to assess the effects of a 1-year mHealth intervention on blood pressure levels and body weight in low-resource urban settings in Peru, 4 years after the completion of the original study. Four years after the original Grupo de Investigación en Salud Móvil en America Latina (GISMAL) study, we attempted to contact the 212 individuals originally enrolled in the study in Peru. The primary outcomes were systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels and hypertension incidence. Secondary outcome measures were body weight, BMI, and self-reported target behaviors. The study personnel collecting the data were masked to the group assignment. Linear mixed models were used to evaluate the effects of the intervention on primary and secondary outcomes in an intention-to-treat analysis. Data from 164 (77.4%) of the 212 originally enrolled participants were available and analyzed (80 in the intervention group and 84 in the control group). The intervention did not result in changes in systolic (-2.54 mm Hg, 95% CI -8.23 to 3.15) or diastolic (3.41 mm Hg, 95% CI -0.75 to 7.57) blood pressure compared with the control group. The intervention reduced the risk of developing hypertension, but the result was not significant (risk ratio (RR) 0.76, 95% CI 0.45-1.28). However, those who received the intervention had lower body weight (-5.42 kg, 95% CI -10.4 to -0.48) and BMI (-2.56 kg/m2, 95% CI -4.46 to -0.66). In addition, compared to the control participants, those who received ≥50% of the scheduled calls during the intervention had greater reductions in body weight (-6.23 kg, 95% CI -11.47 to -0.99) and BMI (-2.81 kg/m2, 95% CI -4.77 to -0.85). An mHealth intervention comprising motivational interview calls and SMS text messaging appears to have effects on health 4 years after intervention completion. Although there were no effects on blood pressure levels, important reductions in body weight and BMI were seen 5 years after randomization.

The corticospinal tract (CST) is a crucial brain pathway for distal arm and hand motor control. We aimed to determine whether a diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)-derived CST metric predicts distal upper extremity (UE) motor improvements in chronic stroke survivors. We analyzed clinical and neuroimaging data from a randomized controlled rehabilitation trial. Participants completed clinical assessments and neuroimaging at baseline and clinical assessments 4 months later, postintervention. Using univariate linear regression analysis, we determined the linear relationship between the DTI-derived CST fractional anisotropy asymmetry (FAasym) and the percentage of baseline change in log-transformed average Wolf Motor Function Test time for distal items (ΔlnWMFT-distal_%). The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) linear regressions with cross-validation and bootstrapping were used to determine the relative weighting of CST FAasym, other brain metrics, clinical outcomes, and demographics on distal motor improvement. Logistic regression analyses were performed to test whether the CST FAasym can predict clinically significant UE motor improvement. lnWMFT-distal significantly improved at the group level. Baseline CST FAasym explained 26% of the variance in ΔlnWMFT-distal_%. A multivariate LASSO model including baseline CST FAasym, age, and UE Fugl-Meyer explained 39% of the variance in ΔlnWMFT-distal_%. Further, CST FAasym explained more variance in ΔlnWMFT-distal_% than the other significant predictors in the LASSO model.

Predictors of membership to trajectories of suicidal ideation were identified by the convergence of four machine learning models, i.e., least absolute shrinkage and selection operator logistic regression, random forest, gradient boosting machine, and classification tree. The course of suicidal ideation was best captured by two trajectories, a favorable and an unfavorable trajectory comprising 173 and 76 participants respectively. Members of the favorable trajectory had no suicidal ideation by week 8. In contrast, members of the unfavorable trajectory had a 60% probability of suicidal ideation by treatment end. Convergent findings of the four machine learning models identified hopelessness, neuroticism, and low general self-efficacy as the strongest predictors of membership to the unfavorable trajectory of suicidal ideation during psychotherapy. Assessment of suicide risk should include hopelessness, neuroticism, and general self-efficacy as they are predictors of an unfavorable course of suicidal ideation in depressed older adults receiving psychotherapy.

Multiple approaches have been devised for pain control in patients undergoing thyroid surgery, with local wound infiltration (LWI) of analgesia and bilateral superficial cervical plexus block (BSCPB) among the popular choices cited. However, the results comparing these methods had either been contradictory or equivocal. This study was carried out to assess the efficacy of BSCPB in comparison to LWI in reducing post-operative pain, as well as any additional opioid requirement in the first 24 h after thyroid surgery. A prospective, double-blinded randomized controlled trial comparing the post-operative pain score between BSCPB and LWI was conducted among patients undergoing thyroid surgery. Ropivacaine 0.50% was used in the study. Pain score was measured at 4, 12, 16 and 24 h after surgery using the visual analog scale (VAS). Subcutaneous injection of Tramadol was given whenever the pain score was ≥4 or requested by patients. A total of 70 patients were recruited, with 35 patients on each arm.

Secondary end points were perioperative outcomes, the conversion rate from one technique to the other, and complication rates with 4 months of follow up. Uterine artery closure at the origin was completed in all 90 patients (0%), whereas closure at the UL was converted to closure at the origin in 11 cases (12.2%; p < 0.001); failures were mainly associated with the presence of endometriosis (81.8% [9/11] vs 10.1% [8/79]; p < 0.001).

This analysis modeled the budget impact of introducing betrixaban for extended-duration VTE prophylaxis in nonsurgical patients with acute medical illness at risk of VTE in the UK, where it is not yet licensed. The 5-year budget impact of introducing betrixaban into current prophylaxis (low molecular weight heparin and fondaparinux) was estimated for the UK NHS. The Phase 3 APEX study provided primary event (VTE, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and death; all-cause or VTE-related) and treatment complications data. Literature informed risk of recurrent events and long-term complications, population, market share, and costs for treatment and management of events. Network meta-analyses informed symptomatic DVT, pulmonary embolism and VTE-related death rates in fondaparinux patients. Deterministic sensitivity analyses explored uncertainty. Introducing betrixaban accrued savings of £1,290,000-£23,000,000 in years 1-5. Savings were from reduced primary VTE events, which reduced recurrent events and future complications. All sensitivity analyses showed savings. Introducing extended-duration VTE prophylaxis with betrixaban in the UK would accrue substantial savings annually over the next 5 years compared to current prophylaxis.

Eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either HCFD (405kcal/day, 100% fat) or placebo in addition to riluzole (100mg/day). The primary endpoint was survival time, defined as time to death or time to study cutoff date. Two hundred one patients (80 female, 121 male, age = 62.4 ± 10.8 years) were included.

Takotsubo Syndrome(TTS), contrary to historical reports, is now increasingly recognised to be associated with substantial mortality and morbidity, both in the short- and long-term. Although TTS is often precipitated by a catecholamine pulse, in-hospital hypotension is a common occurrence, increasing the risk of mortality. Furthermore, despite the transient catecholamine stimulus, there is increasing evidence that there are significant long term sequelae, including persistently impaired left ventricular(LV) systolic dysfunction, myocardial oedema with fibrosis, as well as persistent impairment of quality of life. A definitive therapeutic option to limit the extent of initial myocardial injury, and to accelerate recovery in TTS is therefore justified. However to date, there has been a lack of prospective studies in this area. NACRAM is a multi-centre, randomised, placebo-controlled trial, sequentially testing early use of intravenous N-acetylcysteine(NAC), followed by/or oral ramipril for 12 weeks. The rationale for utilising these agents is related to their effects on limiting nitrosative stress and expression of the inflammasome activator thioredoxin interacting protein(TXNIP); both processes fundamental to the pathogenesis of TTS.

The role of cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is well established in the secondary prevention of ischemic heart disease. Unfortunately, the participation rates across Europe remain low, especially in elderly. The EU-CaRE RCT investigated the effectiveness of a home-based mobile CR programme in elderly patients that were not willing to participate in centre-based CR. The initial study concluded that a 6-month home-based mobile CR programme was safe and beneficial in improving VO2peak when compared with no CR. To assess whether a 6-month guided mobile CR programme is a cost-effective therapy for elderly patients who decline participation in CR. Patients were enrolled in a multicentre randomised clinical trial from November 11, 2015, to January 3, 2018, and follow-up was completed on January 17, 2019, in a secondary care system with 6 cardiac institutions across 5 European countries. A total of 179 patients who declined participation in centre-based CR and met the inclusion criteria consented to participate in the European Study on Effectiveness and Sustainability of Current Cardiac Rehabilitation Programs in the Elderly trial. The data of patients (n = 17) that were lost in follow-up were excluded from this analysis. The intervention (n = 79) consisted of 6 months of mobile CR programme with telemonitoring, and coaching based on motivational interviewing to stimulate patients to reach exercise goals. Control patients did not receive any form of CR throughout the study period. The costs considered for the cost-effectiveness analysis of the RCT are direct costs 1) of the mobile CR programme, and 2) of the care utilisation recorded during the observation time from randomisation to the end of the study. Costs and outcomes (utilities) were compared by calculation of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. The healthcare utilisation costs (P = 0.802) were not significantly different between the two groups. However, the total costs were significantly higher in the intervention group (P = 0.040). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for the primary endpoint VO2peak at 6 months was €1085 per 1-unit [ml/kg/min] improvement in change VO2peak and at 12 months it was €1103 per 1 unit [ml/kg/min] improvement in change VO2peak. Big differences in the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for the primary endpoint VO2peak at 6 months and 12 months were present between the adherent participants and the non-adherent participants. From a health-economic point of view the home-based mobile CR programme is an effective and cost-effective alternative for elderly cardiac patients who are not willing to participate in a regular rehabilitation programme to improve cardiorespiratory fitness. The change of QoL between the mobile CR was similar for both groups. Adherence to the mobile CR programme plays a significant role in the cost-effectiveness of the intervention. Future research should focus on the determinants of adherence, on increasing the adherence of patients and the implementation of comprehensive home-based mobile CR programmes in standard care.", "labels": [[89, 96, "Patient"], [387, 459, "Patient"], [693, 741, "Patient"], [1366, 1512, "Intervention"], [1663, 1817, "Outcome"], [21, 62, "Intervention"], [71, 85, "Outcome"], [334, 347, "Outcome"], [353, 383, "Intervention"], [496, 534, "Intervention"], [539, 579, "Outcome"], [599, 604, "Control"], [626, 660, "Intervention"], [666, 688, "Outcome"], [1001, 1086, "Intervention"], [1531, 1589, "Control"], [2551, 2809, "B"]]}

Understanding the complexities of obesity is important for developing effective interventions. Evidence is growing that addictive-like tendencies toward foods may contribute to obesity in some individuals. The Yale Food Addiction Scale (YFAS, YFAS 2.0) was developed to identify individuals with addictive-like eating behaviors. Diagnosing food addiction (FA) requires meeting a symptom threshold plus clinically significant impairment/distress (self-perceived), but the utility of the impairment/distress criteria remains controversial. This secondary analysis compared individuals who did not meet the FA symptom criteria, met the symptom, but not the impairment/distress criteria, and met both criteria. This secondary analysis of data from a randomized controlled pilot study involving 83 adults with overweight/obesity used descriptive statistics and Univariate ANOVAS to compare YFAS 2.0 and Weight and Lifestyle Inventory responses among the groups. Twenty-eight individuals did not meet the FA symptom criteria, 20 met the symptom, but not the impairment/distress criteria, and 35 met both criteria. Of the latter, 80.0% had severe, 8.6% had moderate, and 11.4% had mild FA. Age at onset of overweight was lower with severe than with mild FA (p = 0.023). The YFAS 2.0 identified a distinct group with severe FA and a group who met the FA symptom threshold, but not the impairment/distress criteria. Few participants perceived impairment/distress unless they endorsed ≥ 6 symptoms. Adding clinical interviews may aid in assessing impairment/distress and addictive-like eating behaviors, particularly in those meeting the FA symptom, but not the impairment/distress criteria.

The Maastricht V/Florence Consensus Report recommends amoxicillin-fluoroquinolone triple or quadruple therapy as a second-line treatment for Helicobacter pylori infection. An important caveat of amoxicillin-fluoroquinolone rescue therapy is poor eradication efficacy in the presence of fluoroquinolone resistance. The study aimed to investigate the efficacies of tetracycline-levofloxacin (TL) quadruple therapy and amoxicillin-levofloxacin (AL) quadruple therapy in the second-line treatment of H. pylori infection. Consecutive H. pylori-infected subjects after the failure of first-line therapies were randomly allocated to receive either TL quadruple therapy (tetracycline 500 mg QID, levofloxacin 500 mg QD, esomeprazole 40 mg BID, and tripotassium dicitrato bismuthate 300 mg QID) or AL quadruple therapy (amoxicillin 500 mg QID, levofloxacin 500 mg QD, esomeprazole 40 mg BID, and tripotassium dicitrato bismuthate 300 mg QID) for 10 days.

In the TL quadruple group, 50 out of 56 patients (89.3%) had successful eradication of H. pylori infection. Cure of H. pylori infection was achieved only in 39 of 52 patients (69.6%) receiving AL quadruple therapy. Intention-to-treat analysis showed that TL quadruple therapy achieved a markedly higher eradication rate than AL quadruple therapy (95% confidence interval: 4.8% to 34.6%; p = 0.010). Further analysis revealed that TL quadruple therapy had a high eradication rate for both levofloxacin-susceptible and resistant strains (100% and 88.9%). In contrast, AL quadruple therapy yielded a high eradication for levofloxacin-susceptible strains (90.9%) but a poor eradication efficacy for levofloxacin-resistant strains (50.0%).

However, prolonged use of epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors in older patients is difficult, owing to potential adverse events. Hence, dose reduction or treatment discontinuation is often required. We investigated the efficacy of low-dose first-line erlotinib and its effects on the quality of life of older patients with lung cancer. A prospective, multicenter, phase II clinical trial was carried out in patients aged ≥75 years with epidermal growth factor receptor-mutant non-small cell lung cancer. Initially, 100 mg/day erlotinib was administered orally; if well tolerated, it was increased to 150 mg/day. The primary end-point was progression-free survival, and secondary end-points were the response rate, overall survival and change in quality of life (Care Notebook questionnaire). The median progression-free survival was 17.8 months, response rate was 63.6% and median overall survival was 27.8 months. The change in the quality of life after 6 weeks was assessed in 72.7% of the patients. Fatigue, pain, anxiety and deterioration in daily activities were found in at least 40% of the patients.

This multicentre, parallel group, single-blind, randomised controlled trial was conducted across two study sites in England. Participants were recruited via 16 patient identification centres, two study sites in England (Nottingham and London), or online self-referral. Eligible participants were aged 9-17 years, had Tourette syndrome or chronic tic disorder, had not received behavioural therapy for tics in the past 12 months or were about to start, and had a Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS) Total Tic Severity Score (TTSS) of more than 15 or more than 10 if they had only motor or vocal tics. Patients were excluded if they had started or stopped medication for tics within the past 2 months; had current alcohol or substance dependence, psychosis, suicidality, anorexia nervosa, or suspected moderate to severe intellectual disability; or presented an immediate risk to self or others; or the parent or carer was unable to speak, read, or write in English. Eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1) by masked outcome assessors to receive 10 weeks of online, remotely delivered, therapist-supported ERP or psychoeducation (active control). Outcome assessors, statisticians, health economists, the trial manager, and the chief investigator were masked to group allocation. Patients were not directly informed of their allocation, but this could be established from the content once treatment commenced and the patients were not, therefore, considered masked to treatment. The primary outcome was YGTSS-TTSS 3 months after randomisation, and analysis was done in all randomised patients for whom data were available for each timepoint and outcome. Safety analysis was by intention to treat. Longer term follow-up is ongoing. This trial is registered with ISRCTN (ISRCTN70758207) and ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03483493).

Continuous beat-to-beat blood pressure measurements were recorded (Finapres Medical Systems, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Autonomic function was assessed non-invasively by heart rate variability (HRV); root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD) and standard-deviation-Poincare-plot (SD1) were used as indices of parasympathetic output. Entropy and detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) were also used. During rest, oxygen supplementation did not significantly alter RMSSD and SD1. During exercise, subjects presented no significant alterations compared with baseline, in most HRV indices examined. There was no improvement of this behavior with O2 -supplementation. Approximate-entropy increased during exercise, with no differences between protocols. IPF patients presented an inadequate adaptive response of their ANS to exercise and recovery. Although oxygen supplementation significantly prolonged exercise duration and prevented the substantial exertional desaturation, the blunted vagal response to steady-state exercise in these patients was not improved, suggesting that acute oxygen supplementation does not sufficiently improve ANS dysfunction in these patients.", "labels": [[90, 161, "Patient"], [651, 669, "Control"], [702, 753, "Patient"], [888, 908, "Intervention"], [912, 923, "Control"], [11, 33, "Intervention"], [37, 86, "Outcome"], [436, 512, "Intervention"], [524, 589, "Outcome"], [925, 1268, "Outcome"], [1778, 2104, "B"]]}

Background Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune and neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system in which disease activity can be monitored with some biomarkers. The aim of our study was to investigate serum Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP) and Neurofilament Light Chain (NFL) in relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients after the aerobic exercise. Methods A total of 38 participants with RRMS (Expanded Disability Status Scale: 1.0 - 4.5) were randomized to a study group (3 × /week for 8 weeks at 60 - 70 % of maximal aerobic capacity (VO2max) + home exercises) and a control group (were given home exercises programme 3 times a week for 8 week). Serum NFL and GFAP levels were analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent analysis method before and at the end of 8 weeks. Results: NFL and GFAP levels were statistically lower in the study group at the end of the study than before the study. In the control group, no significant changes were observed in serum NFL and GFAP levels. ΔNFL levels were significantly higher in the study group than control group. Conclusion It was shown, for the first time that serum GFAP and NFL levels (%10 and % 32, respectively) in RRMS patients decreased after aerobic exercise. Our study is important in terms of investigating the effects of aerobic exercise in individuals with RRMS and elucidating the underlying measurable biomarkers.

Targeted antimicrobial treatment is essential to avoid unnecessary use of broad-spectrum antibiotics and antimicrobial resistance. Targeted treatment relies on a precise microbiological diagnosis - in pneumonia, this poses a challenge as the usefulness of Gram stains and cultures is highly dependent on the quality of the sputum sample. This study aims to examine adverse effects and quality of sputum samples obtained by expiratory techniques (forced expiratory technique and sputum induction) compared with tracheal suction. The hypothesis is that expiratory techniques are non-inferior to tracheal suction in obtaining samples from the lower respiratory tract. This statistical analysis plan (SAP) describes the study design, method, and data analysis of the trial to increase transparency, avoid reporting bias or data-driven analysis and increase the study's reproducibility. The design is a pragmatic, non-inferiority, parallel-arm randomized controlled trial including 280 patients admitted with suspected lower respiratory infection to two emergency departments. Patients are randomized to a usual care group, where sputum samples are collected by tracheal suction or to an intervention group where sputum samples are collected by forced expiratory technique and sputum induction. The statistical analysis will follow an intention-to-treat protocol. This SAP is developed and submitted before the end of recruitment, database closure, and statistical analyses.

A total of 219 long-term nursing home residents who developed an acute illness or change in condition were randomly assigned to HELP-LTC (n = 105) or usual care (n = 114) by unit. HELP-LTC is a multicomponent intervention targeting delirium risk factors of cognitive impairment, immobility, dehydration, and malnutrition. Two certified nursing assistants (CNAs) delivered HELP-LTC components twice daily 7 days per week. In addition, recommendations were given to primary providers to reduce medications associated with delirium. Delirium (primary outcome) and delirium severity were ascertained each weekday by a research assistant blinded to group assignment, using the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) and CAM severity score (CAM-S), respectively. Cognitive function was determined using the Cognitive Performance Scale (CPS). Hospitalization was ascertained by chart review. Participants were 81.7 years of age on average and 65.3% female. At baseline, usual care group participants had better cognitive function than intervention group participants (CPS = 1.33 vs 2.25; P = .004). Delirium symptoms declined over the course of the episode (mean CAM-S = 3.63 at start vs 3.27 at end). Overall, 33.8% of the total sample experienced incident delirium. After adjusting for baseline cognitive function, no significant differences were found in delirium or delirium severity between intervention and usual care groups. Hospitalization was not significantly different between groups. An intervention targeting delirium risk in long-term nursing home residents did not prevent delirium or reduce delirium symptoms.

Children were included if they were: aged 6 months-6 years; AGE diagnosed by a GP; ≥4 reported episodes of vomiting in the 24 hours before presentation; ≥1 reported episode of vomiting in the 4 hours before presentation; and written informed consent from both parents. Children were randomly allocated to either the control group or the intervention group. The control group received CAU, namely oral rehydration therapy. The intervention group received CAU plus one dose of oral ondansetron (0.1 mg/kg). In total, 194 children were included for randomisation. One dose of oral ondansetron decreased the proportion of children who continued vomiting within 4 hours from 42.9% to 19.5%, with an odds ratio of 0.37 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.20 to 0.72, number needed to treat: four). Ondansetron also decreased the number of vomiting episodes within 4 hours (incidence rate ratio 0.51 [95% CI = 0.29 to 0.88]) and improved overall parental satisfaction with treatment (P = 0.027). Children with AGE and increased risk of dehydration due to vomiting could be treated with ondansetron in primary care to stop vomiting more quickly and increase parental satisfaction with treatment. These results could be used to improve the quality and efficacy of general practice medicine.", "labels": [[21, 63, "Patient"], [928, 987, "Control"], [993, 1070, "Intervention"], [1554, 1751, "B"], [0, 16, "Intervention"], [263, 276, "Outcome"], [280, 326, "Intervention"], [336, 344, "Outcome"], [348, 409, "Patient"], [604, 834, "Patient"]]}

To evaluate the effectiveness of a psycho-educational intervention for shoulder and breast day surgery patients in decreasing pain intensity and pain interference with function and strengthening adherence with the analgesic regimen; and further to identify factors that influence average pain intensity and pain interference with function. Pain is one of the most prevalent symptoms after day surgery. However, pain management is left to the patients and family, and interventions to help patients are needed. Randomised clinical trial with an intervention (n = 101) and a usual care group (n = 119) using multiple measurements during 6 months postoperatively. The CONSORT checklist is used. Patients in the intervention group received a booklet about pain and pain management and coaching by research nurses on postoperative days 2, 3 and 7. Differences between groups were identified using the chi-squared analysis and t tests. Changes with time were identified using a linear mixed model with repeated measures. After controlling for covariates, group differences at any time in average pain intensity and pain interference with function were not statistically significant. Changes over time within any one group in average pain intensity and pain interference with function were statistically significant and decreased with time. Higher levels of average pain intensity and pain interference over time were associated with shoulder surgery, female, younger, pain expectation, preoperative pain and poorer adherence. No group differences related to the intervention were revealed, and preoperative teaching together with a pain management booklet and coaching may help to strengthen the intervention's effects. Further research on interventions directed towards pain management is needed. Day surgery patients' postoperative pain and pain management is not satisfactorily handled.

Ustekinumab (UST), a newly-used biologic targeting p40 subunit of IL12 and IL23 in China, exerts a confirmed therapeutic effect on the induction and maintenance therapies for refractory Crohn's disease (CD). Therapeutic drug monitoring based on trough and antibody concentration is of core importance when treating patients who lose response to UST. We aimed to analyze the UST exposure-response relationship in CD treatment in the real-world setting. We retrospectively enrolled patients with CD who received UST between March 1, 2020 and May 31, 2021, at the inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) center of the Sun Yat-Sun Affiliated Sixth Hospital. Baseline characteristic information, biomarker examination, clinical outcomes determined by the Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI), and endoscopic outcomes evaluated using a simple endoscopic score for Crohn's disease (SES-CD) at week 16/20 were collected. The optimal UST cut-off trough concentration was identified using receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis. Nineteen eligible patients were included in the study, the mean age was 29.1 ± 9.1 years and the mean disease duration was 5.5 ± 4.7 years. At the initiation of the study, 89.5% of the patients had been exposed to prior biologics, 42.1% had previous CD-related surgeries, and 52.6% had perianal diseases. At week 16/20 after the UST initiation, clinical response, clinical remission, endoscopic response, and endoscopic remission were 89.5%, 84.2%, 42.2%, and 73.7%, respectively. The cut-off optimal trough concentration for UST was 1.12 μg/mL, as determined by the ROC with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.78, sensitivity of 87.5%, and specificity of 72.7%.

Overall, 133 patients (60 ± 10 years, 57% persistent AF) were randomized to group 1 (n = 67) and group 2 (n = 66), respectively. Complications after AF-ablation were rare (one stroke and no tamponade). The intervention led to a significant reduction of BMI (34.9 ± 2.6-33.4 ± 3.6) in group 1 compared to a stable BMI in group 2 (P < 0.001).

Further analyses showed a significant correlation between BMI and AF recurrence for patients with persistent AF compared with paroxysmal AF patients (P = 0.032). The SORT-AF study shows that AF ablation is safe and successful in obese patients using continuous monitoring via ILR. Although the primary endpoint of AF burden after ablation did not differ between the two groups, the effects of weight loss and improvement of exercise activity were beneficial for obese patients with persistent AF demonstrating the relevance of life-style management as an important adjunct to AF ablation in this setting.

Topically applied PARPi-FL is a molecularly specific, fluorescent contrast-based approach that may fulfill the unmet need for a simple, in vivo, non-invasive, cost-effective, point-of-care method for the early diagnosis of oral cancer. Here, we present results from a phase I safety and feasibility study on fluorescent, topically applied PARPi-FL. Twelve patients with a histologically proven oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) gargled a PARPi-FL solution for 60 s (15 mL, 100 nM, 250 nM, 500 nM, or 1000 nM), followed by gargling a clearing solution for 60 s. Fluorescence measurements of the lesion and surrounding oral mucosa were taken before PARPi-FL application, after PARPi-FL application, and after clearing. Blood pressure, oxygen levels, clinical chemistry, and CBC were obtained before and after tracer administration. PARPi-FL was well-tolerated by all patients without any safety concerns. When analyzing the fluorescence signal, all malignant lesions showed a significant differential in contrast after administration of PARPi-FL, with the highest increase occurring at the highest dose level (1000 nM), where all patients had a tumor-to-margin fluorescence signal ratio of >3. A clearing step was essential to increase signal specificity, as it clears unbound PARPi-FL trapped in normal anatomical structures. PARPi-FL tumor cell specificity was confirmed by ex vivo tabletop confocal microscopy. We have demonstrated that the fluorescence signal arose from the nuclei of tumor cells, endorsing our macroscopic findings.

Objective: To identify the effects of different dietary inositol stereoisomers on insulin resistance and the development of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in women at high risk for this disorder.Design: A preliminary, prospective, randomized, placebo controlled clinical trial.Participants: Nonobese singleton pregnant women with an elevated fasting glucose in the first or early second trimester were studied throughout pregnancy.Intervention: Supplementation with myo-inositol, d-chiro-inositol, combined myo- and d-chiro-inositol or placebo.Main outcome measure: Development of GDM on a 75 grams oral glucose tolerance test at 24-28 weeks' gestation. Secondary outcome measures were increase in BMI, need for maternal insulin therapy, macrosomia, polyhydramnios, neonatal birthweight and hypoglycemia.Results: The group of women allocated to receive myo-inositol alone had a lower incidence of abnormal oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Nine women in the control group (C), one of the myo-inositol (MI), five in d-chiro-inositol (DCI), three in the myo-inositol/D-chiro-inositol group (MI/DCI) required insulin (p = .134).

{"id": 2, "text": "Rationale, Design, and Implementation of Intensive Risk Factor Treatment in the CREST2 Trial. The CREST2 trial (Carotid Revascularization and Medical Management for Asymptomatic Carotid Stenosis) is comparing intensive medical management (IMM) alone to IMM plus revascularization with carotid endarterectomy or transfemoral carotid artery stenting for preventing stroke or death within 44 days after randomization or ipsilateral ischemic stroke thereafter. There are extensive clinical trial data on outcomes after revascularization of asymptomatic carotid stenosis, but not for IMM. As such, the experimental treatment in CREST2 is IMM, which is described in this article. IMM consists of aspirin 325 mg/day and intensive risk factor management, primarily targeting systolic blood pressure <130 mm Hg (initially systolic blood pressure <140 mm Hg) and LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol <70 mg/dL. Secondary risk factor targets focus on tobacco smoking, non-HDL (high-density lipoprotein), HbA1c (hemoglobin A1c), physical activity, and weight. Risk factor management is performed by site personnel and a lifestyle coaching program delivered by telephone. We report interim risk factor data on 1618 patients at baseline and last follow-up through 24 months. The mean baseline LDL of 80.5 mg/dL improved to 66.7 mg/dL. The mean baseline systolic blood pressure of 139.7 mm Hg improved to 130.3 mm Hg. The proportion of patients in-target improved from 43% to 61% for systolic blood pressure <130 mm Hg and from 45% to 67% for LDL<70 mg/dL (both changes P<0.001). The rigorous multimodal approach to intensive stroke risk factor management in CREST2 has resulted in significant improvements in risk factor control that will enable a comparison of cutting-edge medical care to revascularization in patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis.

{"id": 214, "text": "Adaptive conjunctive cognitive training (ACCT) in virtual reality for chronic stroke patients: a randomized controlled pilot trial. Current evidence for the effectiveness of post-stroke cognitive rehabilitation is weak, possibly due to two reasons. First, patients typically express cognitive deficits in several domains. Therapies focusing on specific cognitive deficits might not address their interrelated neurological nature. Second, co-occurring psychological problems are often neglected or not diagnosed, although post-stroke depression is common and related to cognitive deficits. This pilot trial aims to test a rehabilitation program in virtual reality that trains various cognitive domains in conjunction, by adapting to the patient's disability and while investigating the influence of comorbidities. Thirty community-dwelling stroke patients at the chronic stage and suffering from cognitive impairment performed 30 min of daily training for 6 weeks. The experimental group followed, so called, adaptive conjunctive cognitive training (ACCT) using RGS, whereas the control group solved standard cognitive tasks at home for an equivalent amount of time. A comprehensive test battery covering executive function, spatial awareness, attention, and memory as well as independence, depression, and motor impairment was applied at baseline, at 6 weeks and 18-weeks follow-up. At baseline, 75% of our sample had an impairment in more than one cognitive domain.

No previous study has compared lidocaine/prilocaine cream (EMLA) with lidocaine tape for pain relief during arteriovenous fistula puncture in patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis. To this end, we conducted a multicenter randomized crossover study including 66 patients (mean age, 65.8 years; males, 57.6%) undergoing maintenance hemodialysis thrice/week. Subjects were assigned to Sequence EL (EMLA administration followed by lidocaine, with 1-week wash-out) or Sequence LE (reverse administration, first lidocaine then EMLA). All subjects completed the study. At each puncture site, 1 g EMLA (25 mg lidocaine + 25 mg prilocaine) or one sheet of lidocaine tape (18 mg lidocaine) was applied 1 h or 30 min prior to arteriovenous fistula puncture, respectively. The primary endpoint was puncture pain relief, which was measured using a 100-mm visual analog scale. The secondary endpoints included quality of life, which was measured by SF-36, and safety. EMLA produced a 10.1-mm greater visual analog scale improvement than lidocaine tape (P = 0.00001). However, there was no statistically significant difference in the quality of life between the two groups, and no significant carryover/period effect was observed in any analysis.

ACE inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (ACE-I/ARB) may counteract this mechanism, but their association with COVID-19 outcomes has not been specifically tested in the African American population.METHODSWe identified 6218 patients who were admitted into Mount Sinai hospitals with COVID-19 between February 24 and May 31, 2020, in New York City. We evaluated whether the outpatient and in-hospital use of ACE-I/ARB is associated with COVID-19 in-hospital mortality in an African American compared with non-African American population.RESULTSOf the 6218 patients with COVID-19, 1138 (18.3%) were ACE-I/ARB users. In a multivariate logistic regression model, ACE-I/ARB use was independently associated with a reduced risk of in-hospital mortality in the entire population (OR, 0.655; 95% CI, 0.505-0.850; P = 0.001), African American population (OR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.249-0.779; P = 0.005), and non-African American population (OR, 0.748, 95% CI, 0.553-1.012, P = 0.06). In the African American population, in-hospital use of ACE-I/ARB was associated with improved mortality (OR, 0.378; 95% CI, 0.188-0.766; P = 0.006), whereas outpatient use was not (OR, 0.889; 95% CI, 0.375-2.158; P = 0.812).

Hence, increased SpO2 levels in COVID-19 patients could be crucial for their quality of life and recovery. This study aimed to demonstrate that a 30-minute single session of dorsal low-field thoracic magnetic stimulation (LF-ThMS) can be employed to increase SpO2 levels in COVID-19 patients significantly. Furthermore, we hypothesized that the variables associated with LF-ThMS, such as frequency, magnetic flux density, and temperature in the dorsal thorax, might be correlated to SpO2 levels in these patients.Here we employed an LF-ThMS device to noninvasively deliver a pulsed magnetic field from 100 to 118 Hz and 10.5 to 13.1 milliTesla (i.e., 105 to 131 Gauss) to the dorsal thorax. These values are within the intensity range of several pulsed electromagnetic field devices employed in physical therapy worldwide. We designed a single-blind, sham-controlled, crossover study on 5 COVID-19 patients who underwent 2 sessions of the study (real and sham LF-ThMS) and 12 patients who underwent only the real LF-ThMS.We found a statistically significant positive correlation between magnetic flux density, frequency, or temperature, associated with the real LF-ThMS and SpO2 levels in all COVID-19 patients. However, the 5 patients in the sham-controlled study did not exhibit a significant change in their SpO2 levels during sham stimulation.

The aim of this study was to compare how prasugrel and clopidogrel affect platelet aggregation reactivity, cardiac enzyme release, cardiac remodeling, and the formation of in-stent thrombi after primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The advantages of using prasugrel over clopidogrel in cardiac injury following acute coronary syndrome (ACS) remain unclear. A total of 78 ACS patients were randomly allocated into clopidogrel (300 mg loading/75 mg maintenance) or prasugrel (20 mg loading/3.75 mg maintenance) treatment groups, followed by undergoing primary PCI. Platelet reactivity and cardiac enzymes were measured before and after primary PCI. Moreover, cardiac function was measured by ultrasound echocardiography and coronary angioscopic observation was after primary PCI up to 8 months later. Antiplatelet reactivity in the prasugrel treatment group reached optimal levels (P2Y12 reaction units [PRU] less than 262) immediately after the administration and was maintained even at 8 months, independently of the CYP2C19 genotype. Prasugrel treatment significantly suppressed creatine kinase elevation compared to clopidogrel treatment (median value 404 IU/L to 726 IU/L vs. 189 IU/L to 1,736 IU/L, p = 0.018 for maximum values) and reduced left ventricular mass (217.2-168.8 g in prasugrel, p = 0.045; 196.9-176.4 g in clopidogrel, p = 0.061). There were no significant differences in the incidence of in-stent attached thrombi between the two groups. Compared to clopidogrel, prasugrel produced a stable platelet aggregation inhibitory effect in patients with ACS regardless of CYP2C19 genotype, reduced cardiac enzyme release, and prevented cardiac remodeling after ACS.", "labels": [[10, 28, "Intervention"], [32, 75, "Outcome"], [79, 161, "Patient"], [236, 245, "Intervention"], [250, 261, "Control"], [269, 438, "Outcome"], [621, 667, "Control"], [671, 716, "Intervention"], [771, 1005, "Outcome"], [1665, 1885, "B"]]}
{"id": 30, "text": "Surgery for temporal glioblastoma: lobectomy outranks oncosurgical-based gross-total resection. Supra-total glioblastoma resection has gained growing attention with regard to superior long-term disease control. However, aggressive onco-surgical approaches-geared beyond conventional gross total resections (GTR)-are limited by the impairment of adjacent eloquent areas at risk that may entail severe postoperative functional morbidity. Against this backdrop we analyzed our institutional database with regard to potential survival benefits of anterior temporal lobectomy as a paradigm for supra-total resection in patients with precisely temporal-located, non-eloquent glioblastoma. Between 2012 and 2017, 38 patients with isolated temporal glioblastoma underwent GTR or temporal lobectomy at the authors' institution. Both groups of differing resection modalities were compared with regard to postoperative Karnofsky performance score (KPS), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Patients with temporal lobectomy exhibited significantly superior median KPS at the 12 months follow-up compared to the GTR group (median KPS of 80 vs. 60, p = 0.04). Temporal lobectomy was associated with significantly prolonged PFS (p = 0.005) and OS (p = 0.002) coming up to 15 months (95% CI 9.7-22.1) and 23 months (95% CI 14.8-34.5) compared to 7 months (95% CI 3.3-8.3) and 11 months (95% CI 9.2-17.9) for the GTR group. Multivariate analysis revealed temporal lobectomy as the only predictor for both superior PFS (p = 0.037, OR 7.3, 95% CI 1.1-47.4) and OS (p = 0.04, OR 7.8, 95% CI 1.1-55.2). These results strongly suggest temporal lobectomy as an aggressive supra-total resection policy to constitute the surgical modality of choice for isolated temporal-located glioblastoma.", "labels": [[511, 539, "Outcome"], [614, 681, "Patient"], [870, 1001, "Outcome"], [1606, 1791, "B"], [35, 44, "Intervention"], [54, 94, "Control"], [543, 570, "Intervention"]]}
{"id": 305, "text": "Phase II Trial of Continuous Regorafenib Dosing in Patients with Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors After Failure of Imatinib and Sunitinib. Regorafenib at the standard intermittent dosing schedule proved effective in the GRID trial for refractory gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). However, this dosing schedule requires frequent dose reduction, and the progression of GISTs or tumor-related symptoms during the off-treatment period has also been noted in some patients. Therefore, we conducted this phase II trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of regorafenib at a lower dose on a continuous dosing schedule. Patients with measurable, metastatic, or recurrent GISTs who failed to respond to both imatinib and sunitinib were eligible for this study. Regorafenib 100 mg p.o. daily was administered continuously. The primary endpoint was disease control rate (DCR: complete response plus partial response [PR] plus stable disease [SD]) lasting for at least 12 weeks using RECIST version 1.1. The best response was PR in 2 (8%), SD in 16 (64%), and progressive disease in 6 (24%) patients. DCR lasting for at least 12 weeks was 64% (16 of 25). The median progression-free survival was 7.3 months (95% confidence interval, 5.9-8.6), and the 1-year survival rate was 64.5%. Ten patients (40%) experienced grade 3-4 toxicities, including hand-foot skin reaction (n = 4, 16%) and elevation of alanine aminotransferase (n = 2, 8%). Only six patients (24%) needed dose modification with a relative dose intensity of 95.0% for eight cycles in all patients. Regorafenib at a lower dose on a continuous schedule might be an alternative treatment in patients with GISTs after failure of imatinib and sunitinib. Clinical trial identification number.

The aim of this study is the analysis of postural changes of patients affected by vocal disorders post-thyroidectomy, in the absence of post-operative organ damage, through a stabilometry analysis, evaluating the effectiveness of a speech-language intensive treatment in phoniatric and postural quality recovery. 260 patients with vocal dysfunction after surgery without iatrogenic damage were enrolled. 130 patients were subject to post-surgical logopedic rehabilitative training (Group A); other 130 patients were not subject to any post-surgical treatment (Group B). For all patients, vocal and stabilometric parameters were evaluated before and after 2 days and 1 month from surgery. Vocal parameters evaluated were Voice Handicap Index-10, Maximum Phonation Time and objective evaluation of voice with Multidimensional Voice Program (MDVP). Stabilometric parameters evaluated were Sway area (mm 2 ) and Sway velocity (mm/s) in firm surface and foam pad with eyes opened and closed. Regarding the stabilometric parameters, Group A obtained a statistically significant recovery of the correct posture statistically significant compared to Group B, after a month of speech therapy. Vocal parameters (VHI, MPT, MDVP) were statistically different between the two groups (p < 0.05), with a better improvement in Group A.
