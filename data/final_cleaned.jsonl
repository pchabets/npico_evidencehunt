{"id": 2, "text": "Rationale, Design, and Implementation of Intensive Risk Factor Treatment in the CREST2 Trial. The CREST2 trial (Carotid Revascularization and Medical Management for Asymptomatic Carotid Stenosis) is comparing intensive medical management (IMM) alone to IMM plus revascularization with carotid endarterectomy or transfemoral carotid artery stenting for preventing stroke or death within 44 days after randomization or ipsilateral ischemic stroke thereafter. There are extensive clinical trial data on outcomes after revascularization of asymptomatic carotid stenosis, but not for IMM. As such, the experimental treatment in CREST2 is IMM, which is described in this article. IMM consists of aspirin 325 mg/day and intensive risk factor management, primarily targeting systolic blood pressure <130 mm Hg (initially systolic blood pressure <140 mm Hg) and LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol <70 mg/dL. Secondary risk factor targets focus on tobacco smoking, non-HDL (high-density lipoprotein), HbA1c (hemoglobin A1c), physical activity, and weight. Risk factor management is performed by site personnel and a lifestyle coaching program delivered by telephone. We report interim risk factor data on 1618 patients at baseline and last follow-up through 24 months. The mean baseline LDL of 80.5 mg/dL improved to 66.7 mg/dL. The mean baseline systolic blood pressure of 139.7 mm Hg improved to 130.3 mm Hg. The proportion of patients in-target improved from 43% to 61% for systolic blood pressure <130 mm Hg and from 45% to 67% for LDL<70 mg/dL (both changes P<0.001). The rigorous multimodal approach to intensive stroke risk factor management in CREST2 has resulted in significant improvements in risk factor control that will enable a comparison of cutting-edge medical care to revascularization in patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis.

Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is the most frequently reported adverse effect of oxaliplatin. In this study, we set out to evaluate the role of the panaceo-micro-activation (PMA) zeolite in the reduction of the incidence of CIPN and hematological and liver toxicity. The possible impact of the PMA-zeolite as an adjuvant therapeutic agent is based on its detoxification properties toward agents promoting the development of neuropathy (e.g., ammonium - recognized as a neurotoxic agent produced by tumors), as well as its positive impact on immunity and oxidative stress through its effects in the gastrointestinal tract. From April 2015 to October 2018, a total of 120 patients (pts) diagnosed with predominantly colorectal cancer requiring oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy were randomized to receive either the PMA-zeolite (Multizeo Med) or placebo while undergoing oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy. A nerve-conduction study (NCS)&nbsp;was planned at the baseline, after three and six months of chemotherapy, to evaluate CIPN. Furthermore, the evaluation of hematological and liver toxicity was performed during every cycle of chemotherapy. 70.6% and 64.3% of patients developed CIPN in the placebo and the PMA-zeolite group, respectively. Patients treated with the PMA-zeolite were able to undergo more cycles of chemotherapy (p = 0.03), which also indicates a significant improvement in tolerance to the therapy. The group treated with the PMA-zeolite showed a lower CIPN (although not statistically significant within the whole group of subjects) compared to patients receiving placebo. This advantage was, however, statistically significant in men (p = 0.047). In addition, supplementation with the PMA-zeolite resulted in a lower incidence of severe-grade hematological toxicity (trend toward statistical significance of p = 0.09 was observed). Cancer patients may benefit from the therapy with the appropriate certified zeolite-products (e.g., the PMA-zeolite) for human use in CIPN. The lower CIPN (statistically significant results in the male subgroup) was accompanied by a trend of lower incidence of severe-grade hematological toxicity.

This post-hoc analysis examined the temporal relationship between episodes of opioid use and subsequent dropout in a placebo-controlled trial of extended-release injection naltrexone (XR-NTX) to draw inferences about the mechanism by which extended blockade of opioid receptors translates into clinical effectiveness. This was a 24-week multiple-site, double-blind, randomized trial of monthly XR-NTX versus placebo injections.

{"id": 7, "text": "The development of an alternative growth chart for estimated fetal weight in the absence of ultrasound: Application in Indonesia. A fetal growth chart is a vital tool for assessing fetal risk during pregnancy. Since fetal weight cannot be directly measured, its reliable estimation at different stages of pregnancy has become an essential issue in obstetrics and gynecology and one of the critical elements in developing a fetal growth chart for estimated fetal weight. In Indonesia, however, a reliable model and data for fetal weight estimation remain challenging, and this causes the absence of a standard fetal growth chart in antenatal care practices. This study has reviewed and evaluated the efficacy of the prediction models used to develop the most prominent growth charts for estimated fetal weight. The study also has discussed the potential challenges when such surveillance tools are utilized in low resource settings. The study, then, has proposed an alternative model based only on maternal fundal height to estimate fetal weight. Finally, the study has developed an alternative growth chart and assessed its capability in detecting abnormal patterns of fetal growth during pregnancy. Prospective data from twenty selected primary health centers in South Kalimantan, Indonesia, were used for the proposed model validation, the comparison task, and the alternative growth chart development using both descriptive and inferential statistics. Results show that limited access to individual fetal biometric characteristics and low-quality data on personal maternal and neonatal characteristics make the existing fetal growth charts less applicable in the local setting. The proposed model based only on maternal fundal height has a comparable ability in predicting fetal weight with less error than the existing models. The results have shown that the developed chart based on the proposed model can effectively detect signs of abnormality, between 20 and 41 weeks, among low birth weight babies in the absence of ultrasound.

Introduction: ADVANCE was a large, multinational clinical study conducted over 5 years in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In all, 11,140 patients were randomly assigned to receive gliclazide-based intensive glucose control (IGC) or standard glucose control (SGC). IGC was shown to significantly reduce the incidence of major macrovascular and microvascular events (composite endpoint) or major microvascular events compared with SGC, primarily by enhancing renal protection. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of IGC vs. SGC, based on the ADVANCE results, from a Vietnamese healthcare payer perspective. Materials and Methods: A partitioned survival times model across five health states (no complications, myocardial infarction, stroke, end-stage renal disease [ESRD], and diabetes-related eye-disease) was designed. Time-to-event curves were informed by the cumulative incidence of events and corresponding hazard ratios from the ADVANCE study. Health outcomes were expressed in terms of ESRD avoided and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Costs (in US $) comprised treatment costs and health state costs. Utility weights and costs were documented from literature reporting Vietnamese estimates. For sensitivity analyses, all parameters were individually varied within their 95% confidence interval bounds (when available) or within a ±30% range. Results: Over a 5-year horizon, IGC avoided 6.5 additional ESRD events per 1,000 patients treated compared with SGC (IGC, 3.5 events vs. SGC, 10.0 events) and provided 0.016 additional QALYs (IGC, 3.570 QALYs vs. SGC, 3.555 QALYs). Total costs were similar for the two strategies (IGC, $3,786 vs. SGC, $3,757). Although the total drug costs were markedly higher for IGC compared with SGC ($1,703 vs. $873), this was largely offset by the savings from better renal protection with IGC (IGC, $577 vs. SGC, $1,508). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of IGC vs. SGC was $1,878/QALY gained, far below the threshold recommended by the World Health Organization (i.e., 1-3 × gross domestic product per inhabitant ≈$7,500 in Vietnam). The ICER of IGC vs. SGC per ESRD event avoided was $4,559/event. The findings were robust to sensitivity analysis.

In this post hoc analysis of men with available baseline plasma T concentrations, we examined the relationship between clinical/demographic characteristics and T concentrations both as a continuous and dichotomous variable (<300 ng/dL [low T] vs. ≥300 ng/dL [normal T]) on rates of pre-specified CV outcomes, using Cox proportional hazards models. Among 2118 male participants in whom T concentrations were measured, 643 (30%) had low T and 1475 had normal T concentrations at baseline. The low T group had higher rates of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, elevated body mass index, metabolic syndrome, higher blood glucose, hemoglobin A1c, and triglyceride levels, but lower levels of both low-density lipoprotein and HDL-cholesterol, and a lower rate of prior myocardial infarction (MI). Men with low T had a higher risk of the primary composite outcome of coronary heart disease (CHD) death, MI, stroke, hospitalization for acute coronary syndrome, or coronary or cerebral revascularization (20.1%) compared with the normal T group (15.2%); final adjusted HR 1.23, P = .07, and a higher risk of the CHD death, MI, and stroke composite endpoint (11.8% vs. 8.2%; final adjusted HR 1.37, P = .04), respectively.

Background: Lasmiditan is a selective serotonin (1F) receptor agonist approved for acute treatment of migraine with 3 doses: 50, 100, and 200 mg.Objective: To help provide dosing insights, we assessed the efficacy and safety of lasmiditan in patients who treated two migraine attacks with the same or different lasmiditan doses.Methods: Integrated analyses used data from the migraine attack treated in either of two controlled, Phase 3, single attack studies (SAMURAI/SPARTAN), and after the first attack treated in the open-label GLADIATOR extension study. Eight patient groups were created based on the initial dose received in SAMURAI or SPARTAN and the subsequent dose in GLADIATOR: placebo-100, placebo-200, 50-100, 50-200, 100-100, 100-200, 200-100, 200-200. Migraine pain freedom, migraine-related functional disability freedom, most bothersome symptom (MBS) freedom, and pain relief were evaluated at 2-h post-dose. The occurrence of most common treatment-emergent adverse events (MC-TEAE) was evaluated. Shift analyses were performed for pain freedom and ≥1 MC-TEAE. The incidence of patients with a specific outcome from the first and subsequent doses were compared within each dose change group using McNemar's test.Results: Small, but consistent, increases in incidences of pain freedom, migraine-related functional disability freedom, MBS freedom, and pain relief occurred when the second lasmiditan dose was higher than the initial dose. For patients starting on 50 mg, increasing to 100 or 200 mg provided a positive efficacy-TEAE balance, despite an increase in incidence of ≥1 MC-TEAE. For patients starting on 100 mg, increasing to 200 mg provided a positive efficacy-TEAE balance. If the initial dose was 100 or 200 mg, the incidence of patients experiencing ≥1 MC-TEAE decreased or stayed the same with their subsequent dose, regardless of dose. Decreasing from 200 to 100 mg led to a decrease in patients with pain freedom and ≥1 MC-TEAE, resulting in a neutral efficacy-TEAE balance. Shift analyses supported these findings.Conclusion: A positive efficacy-TEAE balance exists for patients increasing their lasmiditan dose for treatment of a subsequent migraine attack.

This evaluator-blinded pilot study compared the efficacy and tolerability of two marketed topical combination acne gels, clindamycin 1%-tretinoin 0.025% (CT) and benzoyl peroxide 2.5%-adapalene 0.1% (BA) in 20 patients with mild to moderate acne vulgaris. Gels were applied daily on opposite sides of the face for 21 days. The primary outcome was difference in transepidermal water loss (TEWL) at the end of treatment. Secondary endpoints were skin moisture content measurement, Investigators' Global Assessment, subject self-assessments (SSA) of burning/stinging, itching, erythema, and dryness/scaling, and Comparative Participant Satisfaction Questionnaire (CPSQ). Efficacy was assessed by inflammatory and non- inflammatory acne efflorescences counts. TEWL increased significantly for both CT and BA (+57.74%, P=0.002; +58.77%, P<0.001); skin moisture content significantly decreased only for BA (-16.47%, P=0.02). Only BA showed a significant increase in erythema and dryness/scaling (P=0.027 and P=0.014) and in SSA burning/stinging (P=0.04). Patient satisfaction evaluation also reflected the strong BA irritation.

Younger patients who underwent vitrectomy for proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) display more aggressive nature distinguished from the older patients.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of ranibizumab pretreatment on vitrectomy surgery in young patients with PDR. This was a prospective nonrandomized comparative study. Young patients (<40 years old) undergoing diabetic vitrectomy with or without ranibizumab pretreatment (25 eyes in each group) were analyzed in this study. The use of the drug was determined by the patients' own preference. The two surgical groups were matched according to a complexity score. Intravitreal injection of ranibizumab (IVR) was performed 3-5 days prior to the vitrectomy surgery in the IVR group. Intraoperative records including total surgical time, intraoperative bleeding, the use of endodiathermy, the frequency of relaxing retinotomies, the incidence of iatrogenic retinal breaks, and the use of perfluorocarbon liquid (PFCL) and silicone oil tamponade, and postoperative indices regarding recurrent vitreous hemorrhage (VH), neovascular glaucoma (NVG), recurrent retinal detachment, and visual outcome were evaluated between the two groups. All patients were followed up for one year after surgery. In young PDR patients, the severity of intraoperative bleeding was significantly lower in the IVR group than in the control group (P=0.04). The total surgical time was shorter in the IVR group than in the control group. However, the rate of relaxing retinotomy, the incidence of iatrogenic retinal breaks and the use of PFCL and silicone oil tamponade were not affected by IVR pretreatment but affected by the complexity score of the case. Early postvitrectomy hemorrhage occurred less frequently in the IVR group than in the control group (P<0.001), Early visual recovery was better in the IVR group than in the control group (P=0.03). However, there were no significant differences in the development of late recurrent VH, NVG, recurrent retinal detachment, and final visual outcome.

Supra-total glioblastoma resection has gained growing attention with regard to superior long-term disease control. However, aggressive onco-surgical approaches-geared beyond conventional gross total resections (GTR)-are limited by the impairment of adjacent eloquent areas at risk that may entail severe postoperative functional morbidity. Against this backdrop we analyzed our institutional database with regard to potential survival benefits of anterior temporal lobectomy as a paradigm for supra-total resection in patients with precisely temporal-located, non-eloquent glioblastoma. Between 2012 and 2017, 38 patients with isolated temporal glioblastoma underwent GTR or temporal lobectomy at the authors' institution. Both groups of differing resection modalities were compared with regard to postoperative Karnofsky performance score (KPS), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Patients with temporal lobectomy exhibited significantly superior median KPS at the 12 months follow-up compared to the GTR group (median KPS of 80 vs. 60, p = 0.04). Temporal lobectomy was associated with significantly prolonged PFS (p = 0.005) and OS (p = 0.002) coming up to 15 months (95% CI 9.7-22.1) and 23 months (95% CI 14.8-34.5) compared to 7 months (95% CI 3.3-8.3) and 11 months (95% CI 9.2-17.9) for the GTR group.

Gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) originates from placental tissue and exhibits the potential for invasion and metastasis. Gene alterations in GTN have not been extensively studied because of a lack of qualified tumor specimens after chemotherapy. GTN has a rapid growth rate and is highly metastatic, which makes circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) sequencing a promising modality for gene profiling. Accordingly, in this study, we performed targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) of 559 tumor-associated genes using circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) collected prior to chemotherapy from 11 patients with GTN.

{"id": 43, "text": "Efficacy and Tolerability of Pitavastatin Versus Pitavastatin/Fenofibrate in High-risk Korean Patients with Mixed Dyslipidemia: A Multicenter, Randomized, Double-blinded, Parallel, Therapeutic Confirmatory Clinical Trial. Dyslipidemia is an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Statins are known to effectively reduce not only low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level but also death and nonfatal myocardial infarction due to coronary heart disease. The risk for CVD from atherogenic dyslipidemia persists when elevated triglyceride (TG) and reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels are not controlled with statin therapy. Therefore, statin/fenofibrate combination therapy is more effective in reducing CVD risk. Here, we assessed the efficacy and tolerability of pitavastatin/fenofibrate combination therapy in patients with mixed dyslipidemia and a high risk for CVD. This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, therapeutic-confirmatory clinical trial evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of fixed-dose combination therapy with pitavastatin/fenofibrate 2/160 mg in Korean patients with a high risk for CVD and a controlled LDL-C level (<100 mg/dL) and a TG level of 150-500 mg/dL after a run-in period with pitavastatin 2 mg alone. In the 8-week main study, 347 eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive pitavastatin 2 mg with or without fenofibrate 160 mg after a run-in period. In the extension study, patients with controlled LDL-C and non-HDL-C (<130 mg/dL) levels were included after the completion of the main study. All participants in the extension study received the pitavastatin/fenofibrate combination therapy for 16 weeks for the assessment of the tolerability of long-term treatment. The difference in the mean percentage change in non-HDL-C from baseline to week 8 between the combination therapy and monotherapy groups was -12.45% (95% CI, -17.18 to -7.72), and the combination therapy was associated with a greater reduction in non-HDL-C. The changes in lipid profile, including apolipoproteins, fibrinogen, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein from baseline to weeks 4 and 8 were statistically significant with combination therapy compared to monotherapy at all time points. Furthermore, the rates of achievement of non-HDL-C and apolipoprotein B targets at week 8 in the combination therapy and monotherapy groups were 88.30% versus 77.98% (P = 0.0110) and 78.94% versus 68.45% (P = 0.0021), respectively. The combination therapy was well tolerated, with a safety profile similar to that of statin monotherapy. In these Korean patients with mixed dyslipidemia and a high risk for CVD, combination therapy with pitavastatin/fenofibrate was associated with a greater reduction in non-HDL-C compared with that with pitavastatin monotherapy, and a significantly improvement in other lipid levels. Moreover, the combination therapy was well tolerated, with a safety profile similar to that of statin monotherapy. Therefore, pitavastatin/fenofibrate combination therapy could be effective and well tolerated in patients with mixed dyslipidemia.

Objectives: Integrative therapies have been incorporated increasingly into health and wellness in the United States in recent decades. Their potential benefits are under evaluation in various situations, including pain and symptom relief for cancer patients and survivors. This pilot study evaluated whether combining two integrative complementary approaches augments a patient's benefit by reducing postoperative stress, pain, anxiety, muscle tension, and fatigue compared with one integrative complementary approach alone. Design: Patients undergoing autologous tissue breast reconstruction were randomly assigned to one of two postoperative complementary alternative therapies for three consecutive days. All participants were observed for up to 3 months. Subjects: Forty-two participants were recruited from January 29, 2016 to July 11, 2018. Interventions: Twenty-one participants were randomly assigned to massage alone and 21 to massage and acupuncture. Outcome measures: Stress, anxiety, relaxation, nausea, fatigue, pain, and mood (score 0-10) were measured at enrollment before surgery and postoperative days 1, 2, and 3 before and after the intervention. Patient satisfaction was evaluated. Results: Stress decreased from baseline for both Massage-Only Group and Massage+Acupuncture Group after each treatment intervention. Change in stress score from baseline decreased significantly more in the Massage-Only Group at pretreatment and posttreatment (p = 0.03 and p = 0.04). After adjustment for baseline values, change in fatigue, anxiety, relaxation, nausea, pain, and mood scores did not differ between groups. When patients were asked whether they would recommend the study, 100% (19/19) of Massage-Only Group and 94% (17/18) of Massage+Acupuncture Group responded yes (p = 0.49).

S44819, a selective GABAA α5 receptor antagonist, reduces tonic post-ischaemic inhibition of the peri-infarct cortex. S44819 improved stroke recovery in rodents and increased cortical excitability in a transcranial magnetic stimulation study in healthy volunteers. The Randomized Efficacy and Safety Trial of Oral GABAA α5 antagonist S44819 after Recent ischemic Event (RESTORE BRAIN) aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of S44819 for enhancing clinical recovery of patients with ischaemic stroke. RESTORE BRAIN was an international, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, multicentre phase 2 trial that evaluated the safety and efficacy of oral S44189 in patients with recent ischaemic stroke. The study was done in specialised stroke units in 92 actively recruiting centres in 14 countries: ten were European countries (Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Spain, and the UK) and four were non-European countries (Australia, Brazil, Canada, and South Korea). Patients aged 18-85 years with acute ischaemic stroke involving cerebral cortex (National Institute of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS] score 7-20) without previous disability were eligible for inclusion. Participants were randomly assigned to receive 150 mg S44819 twice a day, 300 mg S44819 twice a day, or placebo twice a day by a balanced, non-adaptive randomisation method with a 1:1:1 ratio. Treatment randomisation and allocation were centralised via the interactive web response system using computer-generated random sequences with a block size of 3. Blinding of treatment was achieved by identical appearance and taste of all sachets. Patients, investigators and individuals involved in the analysis of the trial were masked to group assignment. The primary endpoint was the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score 90 days from onset of treatment, evaluated by shift analysis (predefined main analysis) or by dichotomised analyses using 0-1 versus 2-6 and 0-2 versus 3-6 cutoffs (predefined secondary analysis). Secondary endpoints were the effects of S44819 on the NIHSS and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores, time needed to complete parts A and B of the Trail Making Test, and the Barthel index. Efficacy analyses were done on all patients who received at least one dose of treatment and had at least one mRS score taken after day 5 (specifically, on or after day 30).

Forty volunteers with moderate to severe chronic periodontitis were recruited, of which at least three sextants required periodontal therapy. At least one of the selected teeth had one site with a probing depth of ≥4 mm. The volunteers received the following three gels: a placebo, lidocaine/prilocaine (Oraqix®), or a liposomal lidocaine/prilocaine, which were applied to different sextants. Pain frequency was registered during treatment and the volunteers received a digital counter to register any painful or uncomfortable experiences. At the end of each session, the volunteers indicated their pain intensity using rating scales (NRS-101 and VRS-4). The volunteers had their hemodynamic parameters measured by a non-invasive digital monitor. Pain frequency/intensity did not show statistical difference between intervention groups.

A prospective, randomized, controlled, non-blind, non-placebo study was performed in a single center.A total of 105 patients who underwent surgery with JJ stent (PNL, URS, pyeloplasty, UNC) were randomized into two groups. 53 patients in Group A received CAP and 52 patients in Group B were controlled without CAP, during the presence of a JJ stent. Patients with external stents, nephrostomy tubes, indwelling long-term urethral catheters were excluded. History of preoperative use of CAP and lower urinary tract symptoms were noted. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) was used as the initial choice of antibiotic however if there was a history of antibiotic resistance in previous urinary cultures, Nitrofurantoin was administrated. Urinary cultures were obtained before surgery and before stent extraction. JJ stents were sent to culture.

We assessed the safety of avapritinib and provide evidence-based guidance on management of avapritinib-associated adverse events (AEs), including cognitive effects and intracranial bleeding. We performed a post hoc analysis of data from a two-part, single-arm dose escalation/expansion phase I study (NAVIGATOR; NCT02508532) in patients with U/M GISTs treated with oral avapritinib 30-600 mg once daily. The primary endpoints were safety and tolerability; the impact of dose modification (interruption and/or reduction) on progression-free survival (PFS) was a secondary endpoint. Efficacy analyses were limited to patients who started avapritinib at 300 mg (approved dose). Of 250 patients enrolled in the study, 74.0% presented with KIT mutation and 24.8% presented with PDGFRA exon 18-mutation; 66.8% started avapritinib at 300 mg. The most common treatment-related AEs (any grade) were nausea (59.2%), fatigue (50.0%), periorbital edema (42.0%), anemia (39.2%), diarrhea (36.0%), vomiting (36.0%), and increased lacrimation (30.8%). No treatment-related deaths occurred. Among 167 patients starting on 300 mg avapritinib, all-cause cognitive effects rate (grade 1-2) was 37.0% in all patients and 52.0% in patients ≥65 years. Cognitive effects improved to a lower grade more quickly with dose modification (1.3-3.1 weeks) than without (4.9-7.6 weeks). Median PFS was 11.4 months with dose modification and 7.2 months without. Tolerability-guided dose modification of avapritinib is an effective strategy for managing AEs in patients with GISTs. Early recognition of adverse events and tailored dose modification appear to be effective approaches for managing treatment-related adverse events and maintaining patients on avapritinib. Dose reduction does not appear to result in reduced efficacy. Patients' cognitive function should be assessed at baseline and monitored carefully throughout treatment with avapritinib for the onset of cognitive adverse events.

Background: Various therapeutic agents have been described for alopecia areata but none is satisfactory. The use of ultraviolet A phototherapy in phototoxic regimens has emerged lately with promising results. Objective: To determine the efficacy and safety of phototoxic regimen of psoralen ultraviolet A (PUVA) in comparison to conventional therapy with intralesional corticosteroids in patients with alopecia areata. Methods: In this randomized controlled clinical trial, 40 patients were randomized to either phototoxic regimen of psoralen ultraviolet A group or potent intralesional corticosteroids group for three months. Study ended at six months. The primary outcome was treatment success: sustained regrowth of hair in ≥80% of the affected areas at six months. Tissue cytokines were assessed at zero and three months. Results: At six months, treatment success was achieved by 45% of patients, similarly in both groups. Tissue cytokine expression correlated well with clinical response. Conclusion: Phototoxic regimen of topical PUVA deserves a place among therapeutic tools used in management of alopecia areata especially in more extensive conditions where intralesional corticosteroids would not be suitable.

{"id": 69, "text": "Efficacy of a Self-Help Web-Based Recovery Training in Improving Sleep in Workers: Randomized Controlled Trial in the General Working Population. Sleep complaints are among the most prevalent health concerns, especially among workers, which may lead to adverse effects on health and work. Internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (iCBT-I) offers the opportunity to deliver effective solutions on a large scale. The efficacy of iCBT-I for clinical samples has been demonstrated in recent meta-analyses, and there is evidence that iCBT-I is effective in the working population with severe sleep complaints. However, to date, there is limited evidence from randomized controlled trials that iCBT-I could also be an effective tool for universal prevention among the general working population regardless of symptom severity. Although increasing evidence suggests that negatively toned cognitive activity may be a key factor for the development and maintenance of insomnia, little is known about how iCBT-I improves sleep by reducing presleep cognitive activity. This study aimed to examine the efficacy of a self-help internet-delivered recovery training, based on principles of iCBT-I tailored to the work-life domain, among the general working population. General and work-related cognitive activities were investigated as potential mediators of the intervention's effect. A sample of 177 workers were randomized to receive either the iCBT-I (n=88) or controls (n=89). The intervention is a Web-based training consisting of six 1-week modules. As the training was self-help, participants received nothing but technical support via email. Web-based self-report assessments were scheduled at baseline, at 8 weeks, and at 6 months following randomization. The primary outcome was insomnia severity. Secondary outcomes included measures of mental health and work-related health and cognitive activity. In an exploratory analysis, general and work-related cognitive activities, measured as worry and work-related rumination, were investigated as mediators. Analysis of the linear mixed effects model showed that, relative to controls, participants who received iCBT-I reported significantly lower insomnia severity scores at postintervention (between-group mean difference -4.36; 95% CI -5.59 to - 3.03; Cohen d=0.97) and at 6-month follow-up (between-group difference: -3.64; 95% CI -4.89 to -2.39; Cohen d=0.86). The overall test of group-by-time interaction was significant (P<.001). Significant differences, with small-to-large effect sizes, were also detected for cognitive activity and for mental and work-related health, but not for absenteeism. Mediation analysis demonstrated that work-related rumination (indirect effect: a1b1=-0.80; SE=0.34; 95% boot CI -1.59 to -0.25) and worry (indirect effect: a2b2=-0.37; SE=0.19; 95% boot CI -0.85 to -0.09) mediate the intervention's effect on sleep. A self-help Web-based recovery training, grounded in the principles of iCBT-I, can be effective in the general working population, both short and long term. Work-related rumination may be a particularly crucial mediator of the intervention's effect, suggesting that tailoring interventions to the workplace, including components to reduce the work-related cognitive activity, might be important when designing recovery interventions for workers.

{"id": 70, "text": "Impact of Serum Bicarbonate Levels on Muscle Mass and Kidney Function in Pre-Dialysis Chronic Kidney Disease Patients. Treatment of metabolic acidosis to target the higher serum bicarbonate level than guideline recommendation may downregulate muscle protein degradation and improve renal function among chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. We conducted a study to test the effects of increased serum bicarbonate level on muscle parameters, nutrition, and renal function in pre-dialysis CKD patients. This was a randomized, controlled study. CKD stage 3-4 patients with serum HCO3- <22 mEq/L were randomized to either receive oral sodium bicarbonate with high target bicarbonate level of 25 ± 1 or standard level of 22 ± 1 mEq/L as control group using protocol-based titration of dosage adjustment. The changes of muscle mass measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), muscle strength by hand grip dynamometer, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) using CKD-Epidemiology Collaboration equation, nutritional markers, and muscle-related biomarkers were determined. Data at baseline and after 4 months of sodium bicarbonate supplementation were compared between groups using Student t test or chi-square test as appropriate. Forty-two patients completed the study (n = 21 per group). The mean age and eGFR were 61.2 ± 9.8 years and 32.4 ± 14.1 mL/min respectively. Serum bicarbonate levels at baseline were 21.0 ± 2.1 mEq/L. Baseline data including sex, diabetes, serum bicarbonate level, creatinine, and blood pressure were similar. After 4 months of treatment, the average serum bicarbonate levels in both groups were 24.0 ± 1.4 and 20.7 ± 2.3 mEq/L (p < 0.001). Both BIA-derived total-body muscle mass and appendicular lean balance were increased at 4 months in the higher bicarbonate group (26.0 ± 5.3 to 26.7 ± 5.5 kg, p = 0.04 and 19.8 ± 4.1 to 20.7 ± 4.4 kg, p = 0.06, respectively) despite comparable body weight and protein intake. Patients in the high bicarbonate group had a significant reduction of plasma myostatin levels, a surrogate of muscle degradation, at the study exit after adjusting for baseline values (-3,137.8; 95% CI -6,235.3 to -40.4 pg/mL, p= 0.04), but unaltered insulin-like growth factor-1 level, as the mediator of muscle cell growth, (141 [106-156] to 110 [87-144] ng/mL, p = 0.13) compared to the control group. Muscle strength, eGFR as well as serum prealbumin were not significantly different between 2 groups (p > 0.05).

Aims: This study design article aims to describe a research study focused on evaluating the use of the Infant-Toddler Checklist to identify children at 18 months with early communication difficulties, and to study the ComAlong Toddler intervention for parents to support their child's communication development. Background: Communication disorders are a common public health problem affecting up to 20% of children. Evidence points to the importance of early detection and intervention to improve young children's communicative abilities and decrease developmental delay. Early identification of communication difficulties is possible with instruments such as Infant-Toddler Checklist. The ComAlong Toddler intervention is tailored to the needs of parents of young children with communication delay before definitive diagnosis. The parents are provided with guidance in communication enhancing strategies during home visit and five group sessions. Methods: The study uses a prospective cohort design. Children were consecutively recruited during 2015-2017, and data will be collected 2015-2023. The screening was performed at the child health centre through use of the Infant-Toddler Checklist. An assessment and first consultation were then performed by a speech and language therapist for children with suspected communication delay according to the screen as well as for children referred for other reasons before the age of 2.5 years. Children with confirmed communication delay were randomised between two interventions: the ComAlong Toddler parental course or a telephone follow-up. Outcome measures include child communication and language skills and use of augmentative and alternative communication. To gain insight into the participants' perspectives, surveys have been collected from parents. Conclusion: The study will provide information regarding identification and intervention for 18-month old children with communication delay.

A 1:1 randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, double-blinded trial (LIPCAL-ALS study) was conducted between February 2015 and September 2018. Patients were followed up at 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 months after randomization.

Method Eight participants were recruited for each of 7 consecutive cohorts for a total of 56 participants. Participants completed 60 hr of aphasia therapy, including 15 hr of VNeST. Two experienced speech-language pathologists delivered the treatment. To promote treatment fidelity, the study team developed a detailed manual of procedures and fidelity checklists, completed role plays to standardize treatment administration, and video-recorded all treatment sessions for review. To assess protocol adherence during treatment delivery, trained research assistants not involved in the treatment reviewed video recordings of a subset of randomly selected VNeST treatment sessions and completed the fidelity checklists. This process was completed for 32 participants representing 2 early cohorts and 2 later cohorts, which allowed for measurement of protocol adherence over time. Percent accuracy of protocol adherence was calculated across clinicians, cohorts, and study condition (intensive vs. distributed therapy). Results The fidelity procedures were sufficient to promote and verify a high level of adherence to the treatment protocol across clinicians, cohorts, and study condition.

This study aimed to evaluate whether vitamin D deficiency is associated with the severity of symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients. Stress and gut inflammation can increase the serum level of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), leading to a change in bowel movements. The aim of this study was to evaluate the anti-inflammatory and psychological effects of vitamin D3 supplementation on the symptom improvement of patients with a diarrhea-predominant form of IBS (IBS-D). Eighty-eight IBS-D patients (age: 18-65 years) based on Rome IV criteria who suffered from vitamin D deficiency and/or insufficiency were enrolled in this randomized, placebo-controlled trial from February 2017 to May 2018 at Rasoul-e-Akram Hospital, Tehran, Iran. Participants were randomly divided into two groups. The intervention group received 50,000 IU vitamin D3 weekly and the control group received a placebo for 9 weeks. All patients received Mebeverine 135 mg twice a day besides supplementation. The IBS Severity Score System (IBS-SSS), serum 25(OH) vitamin D3, CRH, and IL-6 were measured before and after interventions. Seventy-four patients completed the study. The severity of IBS symptoms (p < 0.01) and IL-6 (p = 0.02) decreased significantly in the intervention group as compared to the control group, but there was no significant difference in the serum level of CRH. Also, in the treatment group, IBS-SSS and IL-6 were significantly reduced at the end of the study from baseline (p < 0.01 and p < 0.03, respectively). Our findings indicate that vitamin D3 supplementation can modulate the serum level of CRH and IL-6 and can improve symptoms in IBS-D patients. Vitamin D3 supplementation should be considered in IBS-D patients who suffer from vitamin D deficiency and/or insufficiency. Ziele: Diese Studie untersucht den Zusammenhang zwischen Vitamin-D-Mangel und dem Schweregrad der Symptome von Patienten mit Reizdarmsyndrom (irritable bowel syndrome, IBS). Stress und Darmentzündung können erhöhte Serumkonzentrationen von Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone (CRH) und Interleukin-6 (IL-6) zur Folge haben, die zu Veränderungen des Stuhlverhaltens führen. Mit der vorliegenden Studie sollten die entzün­dungshemmenden und psychischen Effekte einer Vitamin-D3-Supplementierung auf die Symptomverbesse­rung von Patienten mit diarrhödominantem Reizdarmsyndrom (diarrhea-predominant form of IBS, IBS-D) beurteilt werden. Methoden: In diese randomisierte, placebokontrollierte Studie, die von Februar 2017 bis Mai 2018 am Rasoul-e-Akram Hospital in Teheran, Iran, durchgeführt wurde, wurden 88 Patienten mit IBS-D gemäß den Rom-IV-Kriterien (Alter: 18–65 Jahre) aufgenommen. Die Studienteilnehmer wurden randomisiert einer von zwei Gruppen zugeordnet. Die Interventionsgruppe erhielt wöchentlich über 9 Wochen 50’000 IU Vitamin D3, und die Kontrollgruppe erhielt ein Placebo. Alle Patienten erhielten neben der Supplementierung zweimal täglich Mebeverin 135 mg. Vor und nach der Intervention erfolgten eine Beurteilung der Krankheitsschwere gemäß IBS Severity Score System (IBS-SSS) sowie eine Bestimmung der Serumkonzentrationen von 25(OH)-Vitamin D3, CRH und IL-6. Ergebnisse: Vierundsiebzig Teilnehmer schlossen die Studienteilnahme ab. Der Schweregrad der IBS-Symptome (p < 0,01) und die IL-6-Serumkonzentration(p = 0,02) gingen in der Interventionsgruppe im Vergleich zur Kontrollgruppe signifikant zurück, während bei der CRH-Serumkonzentration kein signifikanter Unterschied zu beobachten war. Ferner zeigte sich in der Behandlungsgruppe bei Studienende ein signifikanter Rückgang des IBS-SSS und der IL-6-Serumkonzentration gegenüber Studienbeginn (p < 0,01 bzw. p < 0,03).

Treatment switching adjustment methods are often used to adjust for switching in oncology randomized controlled trials (RCTs). In this exploratory analysis, we apply these methods to adjust for treatment changes in the setting of an RCT followed by an extension study in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. The CLARITY trial evaluated cladribine tablets versus placebo over 96 weeks. In the 96-week CLARITY Extension, patients who received placebo in CLARITY received cladribine tablets; patients who received cladribine tablets in CLARITY were re-randomized to placebo or cladribine tablets. End points were time to first qualifying relapse (FQR) and time to 3- and 6-month confirmed disability progression (3mCDP, 6mCDP). We aimed to compare the effectiveness of cladribine tablets with placebo over CLARITY and the extension. The rank-preserving structural failure time model (RPSFTM) and iterative parameter estimation (IPE) were used to estimate what would have happened if patients had received placebo in CLARITY and the extension versus patients that received cladribine tablets and switched to placebo. To gauge whether treatment effect waned after the 96 weeks of CLARITY, we compared hazard ratios (HRs) from the adjustment analysis with HRs from CLARITY. The RPSFTM resulted in an HR of 0.48 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.36-0.62] for FQR, 0.62 (95% CI 0.46-0.84) for 3mCDP and 0.62 (95% CI 0.44-0.88) for 6mCDP. IPE algorithm results were similar.

Hyperactivity of the IL-23/IL-17 axis is central to plaque psoriasis pathogenesis. Secukinumab, a fully human mAb that selectively inhibits IL-17A, is approved for treatment of psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis. Secukinumab improves the complete spectrum of psoriasis manifestations, with durable clinical responses beyond 5 years of treatment. In the feed-forward model of plaque chronicity, IL-17A has been hypothesized as the key driver of pathogenic gene expression by lesional keratinocytes, but in vivo evidence in human subjects is lacking. We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (NCT01537432) of patients receiving secukinumab at the clinically approved dose up to 12 weeks. We then correlated plaque and nonlesional skin transcriptomic profiles with histopathologic and clinical measures of efficacy. After 12 weeks of treatment, secukinumab reversed plaque histopathology in the majority of patients and modulated thousands of transcripts. Suppression of the IL-23/IL-17 axis by secukinumab was evident at week 1 and continued through week 12, including reductions in levels of the upstream cytokine IL-23, the drug target IL-17A, and downstream targets, including β-defensin 2.

This study assessed the relationship between distress, severity and frequency of attenuated psychotic symptoms in individuals meeting Ultra High Risk (UHR) criteria, both at baseline and over time.

At baseline a combined total of 592 UHR participants (mean age 19.9; males, 53.9%) from two studies were assessed using a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Change over time from this baseline point was assessed using latent growth curve (LGC) models, based on participants from one of the studies. Distress associated with psychotic symptom was shown to be a separate psychological construct from severity and frequency. Distress was also significantly associated with severity but not frequency. Longitudinal LGC models with 244 participants showed that distress, severity and frequency all reduced over six months, although the rate of distress reduction varied across symptom type. Non-bizarre ideas (NBI) were more distressing and had the fastest rate of distress reduction over time. The baseline distress for some symptoms also strongly predicted the symptom severity change over time, suggesting that distress may cause change in the UHR criteria for unusual thought content (UTC) and NBI symptoms. CBT was not shown to be significantly different from treatment as usual (TAU) in its effect on distress. However, distress reduces over time, particularly in the first 3 months after presentation.

As part of its diverse portfolio, the Schistosomiasis Consortium for Operational Research and Evaluation (SCORE) included two cluster-randomized trials evaluating interventions that could potentially lead to interruption of schistosomiasis transmission (elimination) in areas of Africa with low prevalence and intensity of infection. These studies, conducted in Zanzibar and Côte d'Ivoire, demonstrated that multiyear mass drug administration (MDA) with praziquantel failed to interrupt the transmission of urogenital schistosomiasis, even when provided biannually and/or supplemented by small-scale implementation of additional interventions. Other SCORE activities related to elimination included a feasibility and acceptability assessment of test-treat-track-test-treat (T5) strategies and mathematical modeling. Future evaluations of interventions to eliminate schistosomiasis should recognize the difficulties inherent in conducting randomized controlled trials on elimination and in measuring small changes where baseline prevalence is low. Highly sensitive and specific diagnostic tests for use in very low-prevalence areas for schistosomiasis are not routinely available, which complicates accurate measurement of infection rates and assessment of changes resulting from interventions in these settings. Although not encountered in these two studies, as prevalence and intensity decrease, political and community commitment to population-wide MDA may decrease. Because of this potential problem, SCORE developed and funded the T5 strategy implemented in Egypt, Kenya, and Tanzania. It is likely that focal MDA campaigns, along with more targeted approaches, including a T5 strategy and snail control, will need to be supplemented with the provision of clean water and sanitation and behavior change communications to achieve interruption of schistosome transmission.", "labels": [[1680, 1964, "TOREMOVE"], [44, 88, "Outcome"], [360, 422, "Patient"], [298, 356, "Outcome"]]}

{"id": 106, "text": "ICON: a randomized phase IIb study evaluating immunogenic chemotherapy combined with ipilimumab and nivolumab in patients with metastatic hormone receptor positive breast cancer. Immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors (CPI) targeting PD-1 or CTLA-4 has emerged as an important treatment modality for several cancer forms. In hormone receptor positive breast cancer (HR + BC), this therapeutic approach is largely unexplored. We have started a clinical trial, ICON (CA209-9FN), evaluating CPI combined with selected chemotherapy in patients with metastatic HR + BC. The tumor lymphocyte infiltration is predictive for the effect of chemotherapy in BC. In ICON, we use anthracycline, which are considered as immunogenic chemotherapy, and low-dose cyclophosphamide, which has been reported to counter immunosuppressive cells. ICON is a randomized exploratory phase IIb study evaluating the safety and efficacy of combining nivolumab (nivo; anti-PD-1) and ipilimumab (ipi; anti-CTLA-4) with chemotherapy in subjects with metastatic HR + BC. Primary objectives are aassessment of toxicity and progression-free survival. The trial will enrol 75 evaluable subjects, randomized 2:3 into two arms (A:B). Patients in Arm A receive only chemotherapy, i.e. pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD 20 mg/m 2  intravenously every 2nd week) + cyclophosphamide (cyclo; 50 mg per day, first 2 weeks in each 4 week cycle). Patients in Arm B receive PLD + cyclo + ipilimumab (1 mg intravenously every 6th week) + nivolumab (240 mg intravenously every 2nd week). Patients in arm A will be offered ipi + nivo after disease progression. ICON is among the first clinical trials combining chemotherapy with PD-1 and CTLA-4 blockade, and the first in BC. There is a strong preclinical rationale for exploring if anthracyclines, which are considered to induce immunogenic cell death, synergize with CPI, and for combining PD-1 and CTLA-4 blockade, as these checkpoints are important in different phases of the immune response. If the ICON trial suggests acceptable safety and provide a signal of clinical efficacy, further studies are warranted. The cross-over patients from Arm A receiving ipilimumab/nivolumab without concomitant chemotherapy represent the first BC cohort receiving this therapy. The ICON trial includes a series of translational sub-projects addressing clinically important knowledge gaps. These studies may uncover biomarkers or mechanisms of efficacy and resistance, thereby informing the development of novel combinatory regimes and of personalised biomarker-based therapy.

Artemisinin resistance is threatening malaria control. We aimed to develop and test a human model of artemisinin-resistant (ART-R) Plasmodium falciparum to evaluate the efficacy of drugs against ART-R malaria. We conducted 2 sequential phase 1, single-centre, open-label clinical trials at Q-Pharm, Brisbane, Australia, using the induced blood-stage malaria (IBSM) model, whereby healthy participants are intravenously inoculated with blood-stage parasites. In a pilot study, participants were inoculated (Day 0) with approximately 2,800 viable P. falciparum ART-R parasites. In a comparative study, participants were randomised to receive approximately 2,800 viable P. falciparum ART-R (Day 0) or artemisinin-sensitive (ART-S) parasites (Day 1). In both studies, participants were administered a single approximately 2 mg/kg oral dose of artesunate (AS; Day 9). Primary outcomes were safety, ART-R parasite infectivity, and parasite clearance. In the pilot study, 2 participants were enrolled between April 27, 2017, and September 12, 2017, and included in final analyses (males n = 2 [100%], mean age = 26 years [range, 23-28 years]). In the comparative study, 25 participants were enrolled between October 26, 2017, and October 18, 2018, of whom 22 were inoculated and included in final analyses (ART-R infected participants: males n = 7 [53.8%], median age = 22 years [range, 18-40 years]; ART-S infected participants: males n = 5 [55.6%], median age = 28 years [range, 22-35 years]). In both studies, all participants inoculated with ART-R parasites became parasitaemic. A total of 36 adverse events were reported in the pilot study and 277 in the comparative study. Common adverse events in both studies included headache, pyrexia, myalgia, nausea, and chills; none were serious. Seven participants experienced transient severe falls in white cell counts and/or elevations in liver transaminase levels which were considered related to malaria. Additionally, 2 participants developed ventricular extrasystoles that were attributed to unmasking of a predisposition to benign fever-induced tachyarrhythmia. In the comparative study, parasite clearance half-life after AS was significantly longer for ART-R infected participants (n = 13, 6.5 hours; 95% confidence interval [CI] 6.3-6.7 hours) compared with ART-S infected participants (n = 9, 3.2 hours; 95% CI 3.0-3.3 hours; p < 0.001). The main limitation of this study was that the ART-R and ART-S parasite strains did not share the same genetic background. We developed the first (to our knowledge) human model of ART-R malaria.

We describe the adaptation of the first large pragmatic randomized controlled trial of the Whole Health model for chronic pain care for diverse VA clinical settings. Informed by the Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Systems implementation framework, we conducted qualitative semistructured interviews to obtain feedback on trial design from VA leadership, frontline clinicians, and veterans with chronic pain at 5 VA enrollment sites. Next, we convened in-person evidence-based quality improvement (EBQI) meetings with study stakeholders (including frontline clinicians and administrators) at each site to discuss study design; review interview themes; and identify site-specific barriers, facilitators, and approaches to implementation. Ethnographic observations from EBQI meetings provided additional insight into implementation strategies. Seventy-four veteran and VA staff stakeholders were interviewed; 71 stakeholders participated in EBQI meetings. At each site, unique clinical contexts and varying resources for Whole Health and pain care delivery affected plans for trial implementation.

Seventy-eight patients were enrolled in this prospective non-inferiority controlled trial and were randomly allocated to either group C (without the barrier box) or the study group BB (using barrier box).

We used an unpaired two-sample single-sided t-test to test our non- inferiority hypothesis (H 0: Mean TTI diff ≥15 s, H A: Mean TTI diff < 15 s). Secondary endpoints include the number of attempts at intubation, lowest oxygen saturation during induction, and the need for bag-mask ventilation.

The autologous adipose tissue-derived stromal vascular fraction (ADSVF) is a readily accessible source of cells with angiogenic, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and regenerative properties. To evaluate the feasibility and tolerability of local injections of autologous ADSVF in patients with scarred vocal folds. CELLCORDES (Innovative Treatment for Scarred Vocal Cords by Local Injection of Autologous Stromal Vascular Fraction) is a prospective, open-label, single-arm, single-center, nonrandomized controlled trial with a 12-month follow-up and patient enrollment from April 1, 2016, to June 30, 2017. Eight patients with severe dysphonia attributable to vocal fold scarring associated with a congenital malformation or resulting from microsurgical sequelae (voice handicap index score >60 of 120) completed the study.

The primary outcomes were feasibility and the number and severity of adverse events associated with ADSVF-based therapy. The secondary outcomes were changes in vocal assessment, videolaryngostroboscopy, self-evaluation of dysphonia, and quality of life at 1, 6, and 12 months after cell therapy. Seven women and 1 man (mean [SD] age, 44.6 [10.4] years) were enrolled in this study. Adverse events associated with liposuction and ADSVF injection occurred; most of them resolved spontaneously. One patient received minor treatment to drain local bruising, and another experienced a minor contour defect at the liposuction site. At 12 months, the voice handicap index score was improved in all patients, with a mean (SD) improvement from baseline of 40.1 (21.5) points.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, debilitating autoimmune condition characterized by joint synovial inflammation. Current treatments include methotrexate (MTX), biologic agents, and Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors. However, these agents are not efficacious in all patients and there are concerns regarding side effects and risk of infection as these treatments target immune-related pathways. Overexpression and activation of integrin alpha-9 (α9) on fibroblast-like synoviocytes are associated with RA disease onset and exacerbation. The humanized immunoglobulin G1 monoclonal antibody ASP5094 was designed to inhibit human α9 and is currently under investigation for the treatment of RA. This phase 2a, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group study (NCT03257852) evaluated the efficacy, safety, and biological activity of intravenous ASP5094 10 mg/kg in patients with moderate to severe RA that was refractory to MTX. Patients received ASP5094 or placebo every 4 weeks for a total of three administrations. Both treatment groups used concomitant MTX. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients who responded per American College of Rheumatology 50% improvement using C-reactive protein (ACR50-CRP) after 12 weeks of treatment. Biological activity of ASP5094 was assessed via pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of known downstream effectors of α9. Safety was also assessed. Sixty-six patients were enrolled and randomized to placebo (n = 33) or ASP5094 (n = 33). In the primary efficacy analysis, ACR50-CRP response rates were 6.3% and 18.2% at week 12 in the ASP5094 and placebo groups, respectively; a difference of - 11.9, which was not significant (2-sided P value = 0.258). No trends in ACR50 response rates were observed in subgroups based on demographics or baseline disease characteristics, and no significant differences between placebo and ASP5094 were identified in secondary efficacy or pharmacodynamic endpoints, despite achievement of target serum concentrations of ASP5094. Most treatment-emergent adverse events were mild to moderate in severity, and ASP5094 was considered safe and well tolerated overall.

Cognitive function was determined using the Cognitive Performance Scale (CPS). Hospitalization was ascertained by chart review. Participants were 81.7 years of age on average and 65.3% female. At baseline, usual care group participants had better cognitive function than intervention group participants (CPS = 1.33 vs 2.25; P = .004). Delirium symptoms declined over the course of the episode (mean CAM-S = 3.63 at start vs 3.27 at end). Overall, 33.8% of the total sample experienced incident delirium. After adjusting for baseline cognitive function, no significant differences were found in delirium or delirium severity between intervention and usual care groups. Hospitalization was not significantly different between groups. An intervention targeting delirium risk in long-term nursing home residents did not prevent delirium or reduce delirium symptoms. Baseline differences in cognitive function between groups, greater than expected improvements in both groups, quality-enhancing practices such as consistent assignments delivered to both groups, and adaptations of the intervention may have biased results toward null.

There were no significant surgical complications. After RP, 2 patients underwent additional radiation therapy to nodes with androgen suppression for pN1 disease. Median follow-up after completion of treatment was 20.1 months, with 9 of 11 patients having a follow-up period of >12 months. Two patients had biochemical recurrence (prostate-specific antigen ≥0.05) within the first 12 months, with an additional 2 patients found to have biochemical recurrence after the 12-month period. The highest Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events genitourinary grades were 0, 1, 2, and 3 (n = 1, 4, 4, and 2, respectively), and the highest gastrointestinal grades were 0, 1, and 2 (n = 9, 1, and 1, respectively). At 12 months, incontinence was the only grade ≥2 toxicity. One and 2 of 9 patients had grade 2 and 3 incontinence, respectively. On the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (26-item version), the mean/median changes in scores from baseline to 12 months were -32.8/-31.1 for urinary incontinence, -1.6/-6.2 for urinary irritative/obstructive, -2.1/0 for bowel, -34.4/-37.5 for sexual function, and -10.6/-2.5 for hormonal.

This study sought to determine the optimal achieved SBP and whether the treatment effects of sacubitril/valsartan on outcomes are related to BP lowering, particularly among women who derive greater benefit from sacubitril/valsartan. Using 4,795 trial participants, this study related baseline and time-updated mean achieved SBP quartiles (<120, 120 to 129, 130 to 139, ≥140 mm Hg) to the primary outcome (cardiovascular death and total heart failure hospitalization), its components, myocardial infarction or stroke, and a renal composite outcome. At the 16-week visit, the study assessed the relationship between SBP change and Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire overall summary score (KCCQ-OSS) and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP). The study analyzed whether the BP-lowering effects of sacubitril/valsartan accounted for its treatment effects. Average age was 73 ± 8 years, and 52% of participants were women. After multivariable adjustment, baseline and mean achieved SBP of 120 to 129 mm Hg demonstrated the lowest risk for all outcomes. Sacubitril/valsartan reduced SBP by 5.2 mm Hg (95% confidence interval: 4.4 to 6.0) compared with valsartan at 4 weeks, which was not modified by baseline SBP. However, sacubitril/valsartan reduced SBP more in women (6.3 mm Hg) than men (4.0 mm Hg) (interaction p = 0.005). Change in SBP was directly associated with change in NT-proBNP (p < 0.001) but not KCCQ-OSS (p = 0.40).

The hospital and post-discharge intervention includes audit and feedback on HF clinical process measures and outcomes for patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) paired with education to sites and clinicians by a trained, nationally representative group of HF and quality improvement experts. The patient-level digital intervention is an optional ancillary study and includes a mobile application and behavioral tools that are intended to facilitate improved use of guideline-directed recommendations for self-monitoring and self-management of activity and medications for HFrEF. The effects of the interventions will be measured through an opportunity-based composite score on quality and time-to-first HF readmission or death among patients with HFrEF who present to study hospitals with acute HF and who consent to participate.

Hearing rehabilitation after translabyrinthine resection of a vestibular schwannoma (VS) has largely been based on the transfer of acoustic stimulus to the contralateral ear, typically through a contralateral routing of signal hearing aid or bone-anchored hearing aid (BAHA). Cochlear implant, either as a subsequent surgery or simultaneously, has become a more common treatment option; however, there is still relatively limited data available on its success. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the early outcomes of simultaneous cochlear implantation in patients with sporadic VS undergoing translabyrinthine resection. Prospective, nonrandomized study. A prospective study of nonrandomized patients was completed at a tertiary care neurotology center. Audiologic outcomes, primarily based on AzBIO in quiet and background noise, as well as consonant-nucleus-consonant (CNC) testing of the affected ears were utilized. Tinnitus, dizziness, and spatial hearing questionnaries were also completed. Audiologic outcomes and questionnaires were compared between the pre- and postoperative groups. Ten patients were included in the study with 3 month follow-up data. There was statistically significant improvement in AzBO with +10 and +5 signal to noise ratio and in quiet, as well as in CNC testing (P < .05). There was a significant improvement in Tinnitus Handicap Inventory between the two groups. Simultaneous cochlear implantation is a viable treatment for hearing loss after translabyrinthine approach to VS.

This study investigates the efficacy of ointments, containing as main active ingredient the olive oil extract of the marine isopod Ceratothoa oestroides, in the treatment of patients with diabetic foot ulcers. Fifty-two patients were allocated into four treatment groups either receiving therapy with an ointment containing extract of C. oestroides or extract of C. oestroides and eosin or extract of C. oestroides and cefaclor or no treatment. Patients were monitored for a period of 135 days by evaluation of transepidermal water loss, skin hydration, planimetry, photo-documentation, and clinical condition. Treatment with the extract of C. oestroides demonstrated significant healing properties that became evident after 45 days of treatment and resulted in complete ulcer healing in 61% of the patients. A significant improvement in transepidermal water loss (p < 0.001), skin hydration levels (p < 0.001), and wound area (p < 0.001) was observed in all patients.

Patients in the intervention group received a booklet about pain and pain management and coaching by research nurses on postoperative days 2, 3 and 7. Differences between groups were identified using the chi-squared analysis and t tests. Changes with time were identified using a linear mixed model with repeated measures. After controlling for covariates, group differences at any time in average pain intensity and pain interference with function were not statistically significant. Changes over time within any one group in average pain intensity and pain interference with function were statistically significant and decreased with time.

Patients were recruited from 9 university hospitals in France. Analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis with no correction for multiplicity for secondary outcomes. Patients were randomly assigned to receive TCZ, 8 mg/kg, intravenously plus usual care on day 1 and on day 3 if clinically indicated (TCZ group) or to receive usual care alone (UC group). Usual care included antibiotic agents, antiviral agents, corticosteroids, vasopressor support, and anticoagulants. Primary outcomes were scores higher than 5 on the World Health Organization 10-point Clinical Progression Scale (WHO-CPS) on day 4 and survival without need of ventilation (including noninvasive ventilation) at day 14. Secondary outcomes were clinical status assessed with the WHO-CPS scores at day 7 and day 14, overall survival, time to discharge, time to oxygen supply independency, biological factors such as C-reactive protein level, and adverse events. Of 131 patients, 64 patients were randomly assigned to the TCZ group and 67 to UC group; 1 patient in the TCZ group withdrew consent and was not included in the analysis. Of the 130 patients, 42 were women (32%), and median (interquartile range) age was 64 (57.1-74.3) years.

With narrow femoral components, the rate of overhang reduced to 21.5%-30.2% and 9.2%-32.1%. Conversely, underhang rates were higher over the anterior flange width, middle medial-lateral and posterior medial-lateral zones. Standard components displayed higher underhang rates at these zones compared to narrow components. The good fit rate for femoral component was low among the 3 systems ranging from 1.0% to 56.0%.

Aim Accumulated evidence suggests that vitamin A and D agonists can alleviate the development of atherosclerosis. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the effect of vitamin A and D combination supplement on interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and clinical outcome in ischemic stroke. Methods A single-blind, randomized controlled trial was conducted on ischemic stroke patients at Adam Malik Hospital between March 2018 to February 2019. The patients were randomized into 4 groups of the treatment consisting of supplementation using vitamin A or D only, combination of vitamin A and D, and placebo group, all given for 12 weeks. Clinical outcome was determined using the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS). At the time of admission and after the treatment was completed, all patients were measured for vitamin A, vitamin D, and IL-1β serum level, and NIHSS score. Results From the total of 120 patients, in the combination group there were significant increments on both vitamin A (p=0.04) and vitamin D (p=0.01) serum level after 12 weeks of the treatment, compared to the other groups. In conjunction, IL-1β serum level showed a significant decrement in the combination group (p<0.001). Lastly, the biggest improvement of NIHSS could be seen in the combination group, which was marked by the highest decrement of NIHSS score (p<0.001).

ApoCIII concentrations were measured in native and chylomicron-free serum in the fasting state and after a standardized oral fat load test in 195 patients with stable CAD. Clinical follow-up was 48 months. Chylomicron-free serum was prepared by ultracentrifugation (18,000 rpm, 3 h).

Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) represents the cornerstone in atrial fibrillation ablation. Cryoballoon and laserballoon catheters have emerged as promising devices but lack randomized comparisons. Therefore, we sought to compare efficacy and safety comparing both balloons in patients with persistent and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF). Symptomatic AF patients (n=200) were prospectively randomized (1:1) to receive either cryoballoon or laserballoon PVI (cryoballoon: n=100: 50 paroxysmal atrial fibrillation + 50 persistent AF versus laserballoon: n=100: 50 paroxysmal atrial fibrillation + 50 persistent AF). All antiarrhythmic drugs were stopped after ablation. Follow-up included 3-day Holter-ECG recordings and office visits at 3, 6, and 12 months. Primary efficacy end point was defined as freedom from atrial tachyarrhythmia between 90 and 365 days after a single ablation. Secondary end points included procedural parameters and periprocedural complications. Patient baseline parameters were not different between both groups. In all (n=200) complete PVI was obtained and the entire follow-up accomplished. Balloon only PVI was obtained in 98% (cryoballoon) versus 95% (laserballoon) requiring focal touch-up in 2 and 5 patients, respectively.

Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7), a neurodegenerative disease characterized by cerebellar ataxia and retinal degeneration, is caused by an abnormal CAG repeat expansion in the ATXN7 gene coding region. The onset and severity of SCA7 are highly variable between patients, thus identification of sensitive biomarkers that accurately diagnose the disease and monitoring its progression are needed. With the aim of identified SCA7-specific metabolites with clinical relevance, we report for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, a metabolomics profiling of circulating acylcarnitines and amino acids in SCA7 patients. We identified 21 metabolites with altered levels in SCA7 patients and determined two different sets of metabolites with diagnostic power. The first signature of metabolites (Valine, Leucine, and Tyrosine) has the ability to discriminate between SCA7 patients and healthy controls, while the second one (Methionine, 3-hydroxytetradecanoyl-carnitine, and 3-hydroxyoctadecanoyl-carnitine) possess the capability to differentiate between early-onset and adult-onset patients, as shown by the multivariate model and ROC analyses. Furthermore, enrichment analyses of metabolic pathways suggest alterations in mitochondrial function, energy metabolism, and fatty acid beta-oxidation in SCA7 patients.

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), due to their potential for differentiation into alveolar epithelial cells and their immunosuppressive characteristics, are considered a new therapeutic agent in cell-based therapy of inflammatory lung disorders, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Since most of the MSC-mediated beneficent effects were the consequence of their paracrine action, herewith, we investigated the effects of a newly designed MSC-derived product Exosome-derived Multiple Allogeneic Protein Paracrine Signaling (Exo-d-MAPPS) in the attenuation of chronic airway inflammation by using an animal model of COPD (induced by chronic exposure to cigarette smoke (CS)) and clinical data obtained from Exo-d-MAPPS-treated COPD patients. Exo-d-MAPPS contains a high concentration of immunomodulatory factors which are capable of attenuating chronic airway inflammation, including soluble TNF receptors I and II, IL-1 receptor antagonist, and soluble receptor for advanced glycation end products. Accordingly, Exo-d-MAPPS significantly improved respiratory function, downregulated serum levels of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-12, and IFN-γ), increased serum concentration of immunosuppressive IL-10, and attenuated chronic airway inflammation in CS-exposed mice. The cellular makeup of the lungs revealed that Exo-d-MAPPS treatment attenuated the production of inflammatory cytokines in lung-infiltrated macrophages, neutrophils, and natural killer and natural killer T cells and alleviated the antigen-presenting properties of lung-infiltrated macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs). Additionally, Exo-d-MAPPS promoted the expansion of immunosuppressive IL-10-producing alternatively activated macrophages, regulatory DCs, and CD4+FoxP3+T regulatory cells in inflamed lungs which resulted in the attenuation of chronic airway inflammation. In a similar manner, as it was observed in an animal model, Exo-d-MAPPS treatment significantly improved the pulmonary status and quality of life of COPD patients. Importantly, Exo-d-MAPPS was well tolerated since none of the 30 COPD patients reported any adverse effects after Exo-d-MAPPS administration. In summing up, we believe that Exo-d-MAPPS could be considered a potentially new therapeutic agent in the treatment of chronic inflammatory lung diseases whose efficacy should be further explored in large clinical trials.", "labels": [[609, 721, "Intervention"], [744, 924, "Patient"], [72, 121, "Intervention"], [140, 167, "Patient"], [2346, 2566, "TOREMOVE"]]}

Background and objectives: The fixed-rate continuous background infusion mode with bolus dosing is a common modality for intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (PCA). However, some patients suffer from inadequate analgesia or opioid-related adverse effects due to the biphasic pattern of postoperative pain. Therefore, we investigated the postoperative analgesic efficacy of PCA using an optimizing background infusion mode (OBIM) where the background injection rate varies depending on the patient's bolus demand. Materials and Methods: We prospectively enrolled 204 patients who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy in a randomized, controlled, double-blind study. Patients were allocated to either the optimizing (group OBIM) or the traditional background infusion group (group TBIM). The numeric rating scale (NRS) score for pain was evaluated at admission to and discharge from the recovery room, as well as at the 6th, 24th, and 48th postoperative hours. Data on bolus demand count, total infused volume, and background infusion rate were downloaded from the PCA device at 30-min intervals until the 48th postoperative hour. Results: The NRS score was not significantly different between groups throughout the postoperative period (p = 0.621), decreasing with time in both groups (p < 0.001). The bolus demand count was not significantly different between groups throughout (p = 0.756).

The total cumulative opioid dose in fentanyl equivalents, after converting sufentanil to fentanyl using an equipotential dose ratio, was lower in group OBIM (714.1 (647.4-780.9) μg) than in group TBIM (963.7 (870.5-1056.9) μg); p < 0.001). The background infusion rate was significantly different between groups throughout the study period (p < 0.001); it was higher in group OBIM than in group TBIM before the 12th postoperative hour and lower from the 18th to the 48th postoperative hour.

The long-term effects of behavioural medical rehabilitation (BMR), as a type of multidisciplinary rehabilitation, in the treatment of chronic non-specific low back pain (CLBP) have been shown. However, the specific effects of behavioural exercise therapy (BET) compared to standard exercise therapy (SET) within BMR are not well understood. The aim of the study was to assess the effectiveness of BMR + BET compared to BMR + SET in individuals with CLBP in a two-armed, pre-registered, multicentre, parallel, randomised controlled trial (RCT). A total of 351 adults with CLBP in two rehabilitation centres were online randomised based on an 'urn randomisation' algorithm to either BMR + SET (n = 175) or BMR + BET (n = 176). Participants in both study groups were non-blinded and received BMR, consisting of an multidisciplinary admission, a psychosocial assessment, multidisciplinary case management, psychological treatment, health education and social counselling. The intervention group (BMR + BET) received a manualised, biopsychosocial BET within BMR. The aim of BET was to develop self-management strategies in coping with CLBP. The control group (BMR + SET) received biomedical SET within BMR with the aim to improve mainly physical fitness. Therapists in both study groups were not blinded. The BMR lasted on average 27 days, and both exercise programmes had a mean duration of 26 h. The primary outcome was functional ability at 12 months. Secondary outcomes were e.g. pain, avoidance-endurance, pain management and physical activity. The analysis was by intention-to-treat, blinded to the study group, and used a linear mixed model. There were no between-group differences observed in function at the end of the BMR (mean difference, 0.08; 95% CI - 2.82 to 2.99; p = 0.955), at 6 months (mean difference, - 1.80; 95% CI; - 5.57 to 1.97; p = 0.349) and at 12 months (mean difference, - 1.33; 95% CI - 5.57 to 2.92; p = 0.540).

SAVR patients in a randomized trial of 2 embolic protection devices underwent a protocol-defined 5-view epiaortic ultrasound read at a core laboratory. Aortic atherosclerosis was quantified with the Katz atheroma grade, and patients were categorized as mild (grade I-II) or moderate/severe (grade III-V).

Precannulation epiaortic ultrasound data were available for 326 of 383 randomized patients (85.1%). Of these, 106 (32.5%) had moderate/severe Katz atheroma grade at any segment of the ascending aorta. Although differences in the composite of death, stroke, or cerebral infarction on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging by 7 days were not statistically significant, moderate/severe atheroma grade was associated with a greater risk of AKI by 7 days (adjusted odds ratio, 2.63; 95% confidence interval, 1.24-5.58; P = .01).

One hundred and forty-six patients were treated for early stage, distant-metastases-free HR+ BC in an accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) phase II trial. Immunohistochemistry was used to double-stain two adjoining sets of tissue microarrays from pre-RT (radiotherapy) tumour resection samples for CD1a/CD20 and CD45RO/CD4. Cell densities of CD1a+, CD20+, CD45RO+ and CD4+ TIICs in the stromal and intraepithelial compartment were registered semiautomatically. High densities of CD20+ and CD4+ TIICs were strongly associated with reduced disease-free survival (DFS), while high stromal CD45RO+ TIIC densities were indicators of subsequent successful treatment. An immunoscore based on CD20+ and CD45RO+ TIIC densities identified three different risk groups (p < 0.001).

This study aimed to investigate the volume of red blood cells (RBCs) salvaged and the components of amniotic fluid (AF) in blood salvaged by one suction device or two devices during CS in patients with placenta previa and/or accrete. Thirty patients with placenta previa and/or accrete undergoing elective CS in the Women's Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine were recruited for the present study from November 1, 2017 to December 1, 2018. The patients were randomly assigned to one of the two groups according to an Excel-generated random number sheet: Group 1 (n = 15), in which only one suction device was used to aspirate all blood and AF, and Group 2 (n = 15), in which a second suction device was mainly used to aspirate AF before the delivery of the placenta. Three samples of blood per patient (pre-wash, post-wash, and post-filtration) were collected to measure AF components. The salvaged RBC volumes were recorded. Continuous data of pre-wash, post-wash, and post-filtration samples were analyzed by using one-way analysis of variance with Tukey's test for multiple comparisons, or Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn test for multiple comparisons. Comparisons of continuous data between Group 1 and Group 2 were conducted using Student's t test or Mann-Whitney U test.

Small fibre neuropathy is a common pain disorder, which in many cases fails to respond to treatment with existing medications. Gain-of-function mutations of voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.7 underlie dorsal root ganglion neuronal hyperexcitability and pain in a subset of patients with small fibre neuropathy. Recent clinical studies have demonstrated that lacosamide, which blocks sodium channels in a use-dependent manner, attenuates pain in some patients with Nav1.7 mutations; however, only a subgroup of these patients responded to the drug. Here, we used voltage-clamp recordings to evaluate the effects of lacosamide on five Nav1.7 variants from patients who were responsive or non-responsive to treatment. We show that, at the clinically achievable concentration of 30 μM, lacosamide acts as a potent sodium channel inhibitor of Nav1.7 variants carried by responsive patients, via a hyperpolarizing shift of voltage-dependence of both fast and slow inactivation and enhancement of use-dependent inhibition. By contrast, the effects of lacosamide on slow inactivation and use-dependence in Nav1.7 variants from non-responsive patients were less robust. Importantly, we found that lacosamide selectively enhances fast inactivation only in variants from responders. Taken together, these findings begin to unravel biophysical underpinnings that contribute to responsiveness to lacosamide in patients with small fibre neuropathy carrying select Nav1.7 variants.", "labels": [[23, 33, "Intervention"], [741, 751, "Intervention"], [755, 840, "Patient"], [37, 124, "Patient"], [1399, 1593, "TOREMOVE"], [0, 19, "Outcome"]]}

Patients aged 18 years or older with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, HER2-positive, operable, locally advanced, or inflammatory stage II-IIIC breast cancer, and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 55% or more were randomly assigned (1:1), using a voice-based or web-based response system, to receive intravenous pertuzumab (840 mg loading dose, followed by 420 mg maintenance doses) plus intravenous trastuzumab (8 mg/kg loading dose, followed by 6 mg/kg maintenance doses) or the fixed-dose combination of pertuzumab and trastuzumab for subcutaneous injection (1200 mg pertuzumab plus 600 mg trastuzumab loading dose in 15 mL, followed by 600 mg pertuzumab plus 600 mg trastuzumab maintenance doses in 10 mL), both administered every 3 weeks with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Patients were stratified by hormone receptor status, clinical stage, and chemotherapy regimen. The investigator selected one of the two protocol-approved standard chemotherapy regimens before randomisation. Four cycles of HER2-targeted therapy were administered concurrently with the taxane. After surgery, patients continued the HER2-targeted therapy to receive an additional 14 cycles (total of 18). The primary endpoint was non-inferiority of the cycle 7 pertuzumab serum trough concentration (Ctrough; ie, cycle 8 predose pertuzumab concentration) within the fixed-dose combination for subcutaneous injection versus intravenous pertuzumab plus trastuzumab in the per-protocol pharmacokinetic population (all enrolled patients who adhered to prespecified criteria for pharmacokinetic assessment). Non-inferiority was concluded if the lower bound of the 90% CI of the geometric mean ratio was 0·8 or higher. The safety population included all patients who received at least one dose of study medication, including chemotherapy or HER2-targeted therapy. Enrolment, neoadjuvant therapy, and surgery have been completed; adjuvant treatment and follow-up are ongoing. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03493854. Between June 14, 2018, and Dec 24, 2018, 252 patients were randomly assigned to the intravenous infusion group and 248 to the fixed-dose combination group. The geometric mean ratio of pertuzumab serum Ctrough subcutaneous to serum Ctrough intravenous was 1·22 (90% CI 1·14-1·31). The most common grade 3-4 adverse events occurring during neoadjuvant treatment with HER2-targeted therapy plus chemotherapy in 5% or more of patients were neutropenia (34 [13%] of 252 patients in the intravenous infusion group vs 35 [14%] of 248 patients in the fixed-dose combination group), decreased neutrophil count (31 [12%] vs 27 [11%]), febrile neutropenia (14 [6%] vs 16 [6%]), diarrhoea (12 [5%] vs 17 [7%]), and decreased white blood cell count (18 [7%] vs nine [4%]). At least one treatment-related serious adverse event was reported in 25 (10%) patients in the intravenous infusion group and 26 (10%) patients in the fixed-dose combination group. One patient in each treatment group had an adverse event that led to death (urosepsis in the intravenous infusion group and acute myocardial infarction in the fixed-dose combination group); neither death was related to HER2-targeted therapy. The study met its primary endpoint: the fixed-dose combination of pertuzumab and trastuzumab for subcutaneous injection provides non-inferior cycle 7 pertuzumab serum Ctrough concentrations to intravenous pertuzumab plus trastuzumab in the neoadjuvant setting with comparable total pathological complete response rates, supporting the FDA approval.

In this retrospective study, we investigated the potential value of CT texture features to diagnose LN metastasis using preoperative CT data and patient characteristics by developing quantitative prediction models. A total of 390 CC patients, undergone surgical resection, were enrolled in this monocentric study. 390 histologically validated LNs were collected from patients and randomly separated into training (312 patients, 155 metastatic and 157 normal LNs) and test cohorts (78 patients, 39 metastatic and 39 normal LNs). Six patient characteristics and 146 quantitative CT imaging features were analyzed and key variables were determined using either exhaustive search or least absolute shrinkage algorithm. Two kernel-based support vector machine classifiers (patient-characteristic model and radiomic-derived model), generated with 10-fold cross-validation, were compared with the clinical model that utilizes long-axis diameter for diagnosis of metastatic LN. The performance of the models was evaluated on the test cohort by computing accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating curve (AUC).

For normally sighted readers, word neighborhood size (i.e., the total number of words that can be formed from a single word by changing only one letter) has a facilitator effect on word recognition. When reading with central field loss (CFL) however, individual letters may not be correctly identified, leading to possible misidentifications and a reverse neighborhood size effect. Here we investigate this inhibitory effect of word neighborhood size on reading performance and whether it is modulated by word predictability and reading proficiency. Nineteen patients with binocular CFL from 32 to 89 years old (mean ± SD = 75 ± 15) read short sentences presented with the self-paced reading paradigm. Accuracy and reading time were measured for each target word read, along with its predictability, i.e., its probability of occurrence following the two preceding words in the sentence using a trigram analysis. Linear mixed effects models were then fit to estimate the individual contributions of word neighborhood size, predictability, frequency and length on accuracy and reading time, while taking patients' reading proficiency into account. For the less proficient readers, who have given up daily reading as a consequence of their visual impairment, we found that the effect of neighborhood size was reversed compared to normally sighted readers and of higher amplitude than the effect of frequency. Furthermore, this inhibitory effect is of greater amplitude (up to 50% decrease in reading speed) when a word is not easily predictable because its chances to occur after the two preceding words in a specific sentence are rather low. Severely impaired patients with CFL often quit reading on a daily basis because this task becomes simply too exhausting.

Self-management of hypertension is of great significance given its increasing incidence and its associated disabilities. In view of the increased use of mobile health in medicine, the present study evaluated the effect of a self-management application on patient adherence to hypertension treatment. This clinical trial was performed on 120 hypertensive patients who were provided with a mobile intervention for 8 weeks and followed up until the 24th week. Data on the primary outcome (adherence to treatment) and secondary outcomes (adherence to the DASH diet, regular monitoring of blood pressure, and physical activity) were collected using a questionnaire and a mobile application, respectively. The inter-group change difference over time was analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA (general linear model). The treatment adherence score increased by an average of 5.9 (95% CI 5.0-6.7) in the intervention group compared to the control group. The scores of adherence to the low-fat and low-salt diet plans were 1.7 (95% CI 1.3-2.1) and 1.5 (95% CI 1.2-1.9), respectively. Moreover, moderate physical activity increased to 100.0 min (95% CI 61.7-138.3) per week in the intervention group.

Objective: It is unclear whether the institution of gluten-free diet (GFD) is beneficial in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) and subclinical celiac disease (CD). Our primary objective was to evaluate the effect of GFD on the frequency of hypoglycemia, in patients with T1DM and subclinical CD. Our secondary objective was to investigate the effect of GFD on height, weight, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), insulin dose requirement, and bone mineral homeostasis. Methods: We carried out a prospective open label randomized controlled trial (RCT). Patients with T1DM and subclinical CD were randomized to receive GFD or a normal diet for 1 year. The primary outcome was the frequency of hypoglycemic episodes (blood glucose <70 mg/dL) measured by self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) at the sixth month of the study in the 2 groups. Results: Screening for CD was carried out in 320 T1DM patients. Thirty eligible patients were randomized to receive GFD (n = 15) or a normal diet (n = 15). The mean number of hypoglycemic episodes/month recorded by SMBG and the mean time spent in hypoglycemia measured by CGM (minutes) in the GFD group versus the non-GFD group at six months was 2.3 minutes versus 3.4 minutes (P = .5) and 124.1 minutes versus 356.9 minutes (P = .1), respectively. The mean number of hypoglycemic episodes/month significantly declined in the GFD group (3.5 episodes at baseline versus 2.3 episodes at the sixth month; P = .03). The mean HbA1c declined by 0.73% in the GFD group and rose by 0.99% in non-GFD group at study completion. Conclusion: This is the first RCT to assess the effect of GFD in T1DM and subclinical CD.

The Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes Blood Pressure trial (ACCORD BP), a two-by-two factorial randomized controlled trial, examined effects of SBP (<120 vs. <140 mmHg) and glycemic (HbA1c <6% vs. 7.0-7.9% [<42 vs. 53-63 mmol/mol]) control on cardiovascular events in T2DM (N = 4,731). We examined whether effects of SBP control on cardiovascular composite were modified by baseline DBP and glycemic control. Intensive SBP lowering decreased the risk of the cardiovascular composite (hazard ratio [HR] 0.76 [95% CI 0.59-0.98]) in the standard glycemic arm but not in the intensive glycemic arm (HR 1.06 [95% CI 0.81-1.40]). Spline regression models relating the effects of the intervention on the cardiovascular composite across the range of baseline DBP did not show evidence of effect modification by low baseline DBP for the cardiovascular composite in the standard or intensive glycemic arms. The relation between the effect of the intensive SBP intervention and baseline DBP was similar between glycemic arms for the cardiovascular composite three-way interaction (P = 0.83). In persons with T2DM, intensive SBP lowering decreased the risk of cardiovascular composite end point irrespective of baseline DBP in the setting of standard glycemic control.

During general anaesthesia, most patients develop atelectasis, which promotes postoperative pulmonary complications. RCTs that investigated perioperative lung protection have failed to reduce postoperative pulmonary complications consistently. Ultrasound imaging could help confirm the effects of different protective ventilatory strategies, but this has not been tested in trials. The objective of this study was to use ultrasonography to evaluate whether lung-protective ventilation measures reduce perioperative atelectasis. We conducted a prospective, randomised patient- and assessor-blinded controlled trial in women undergoing open gynaecological surgery. Subjects were randomised to either lung protection or zero end-expiratory pressure (ZEEP; with no recruitment manoeuvres [RMs]). Lung protection entailed PEEP (7 cm H2O) and RMs every 30 min. Lung ultrasonography was undertaken at five predefined time points. The primary outcome was the difference in lung ultrasonography score (LUS) between groups before emergence; a lower LUS indicates better lung aeration. We recruited 45 women (34-85 yr old). Women randomised to lung protection had lower mean (standard deviation) LUS before emergence (6.1 [3.7]), compared with women randomised to ZEEP (11.7 [3.9]; 95% confidence interval for the difference between group means [-7.9 to -3.2]; P<0.0001).

In each patient, the background-subtracted thermal image, referred to as full thermal image, was used to extract novel parametric cold thermal feature images. From these images, statistical features, viz., correlation, energy, homogeneity, contrast, entropy, mean, standard deviation (SD), skewness, and kurtosis, were calculated and the two groups of patients (control and diseased: a total of 80 carotid artery samples) were classified.

In the STROKESTOP II study, a Swedish mass screening study for AF among 75- and 76-year-olds, participants with NT-proBNP ≥125 ng/L performed intermittent ECG recordings 30 s, four times daily for 2 weeks. Participants with micro-AF (sudden onset of irregular tachycardia with episodes of ≥5 consecutive supraventricular beats and total absence of p-waves, lasting less than 30 s) were invited to undergo extended AF screening using continuous event recording for 2 weeks. A control group of individuals without micro-AF was examined using the same ECG modalities. Out of 3763 participants in STROKESTOP II who had elevated NT-proBNP levels and were free of AF, n = 221 (6%) had micro-AF. The majority of participants with micro-AF (n = 196) accepted further investigation with continuous ECG monitoring which showed presence of AF in 26 of them. In the control group (n = 250), continuous monitoring detected 7 new AF cases. Thus, AF was significantly more common in the micro AF group (13%) compared to the control group (3%), p < 0.001. Presence of short-lasting episodes of AF-like activity (micro-AF) indicates increased likelihood for undetected AF.

Cerebral palsy (CP) is a syndrome of childhood movement and posture disorders. Clinical evidence is still limited and sometimes inconclusive about the benefits of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSCs) for CP. We conducted a randomized trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of hUC-MSC transplantation concomitant with rehabilitation in patients with CP. Eligible patients were allocated into the hUC-MSC group and control group. In addition to rehabilitation, the patients in the hUC-MSC group received four transfusions of hUC-MSCs intravenously, while the control group received a placebo. Adverse events (AEs) were collected for safety evaluation in the 12-month follow-up phase. Primary endpoints were assessed as activities of daily living (ADL), comprehensive function assessment (CFA), and gross motor function measure (GMFM) scales. In addition, cerebral metabolic activity was detected by  18 F-FDG-PET/CT to explore the possible mechanism of the therapeutic effects. Primary endpoint data were analyzed by ANOVA using SPSS version 20.0. Forty patients were enrolled, and 1 patient withdrew informed consent. Therefore, 39 patients received treatments and completed the scheduled assessments. No significant difference was shown between the 2 groups in AE incidence. Additionally, significant improvements in ADL, CFA, and GMFM were observed in the hUC-MSC group compared with the control group. In addition, the standard uptake value of  18 F-FDG was markedly increased in 3 out of 5 patients from the hUC-MSC group at 12 months after transplantation. Our clinical data showed that hUC-MSC transplantation was safe and effective at improving the gross motor and comprehensive function of children with CP when combined with rehabilitation.

To examine whether subconcussive head impacts cause impairments in neuro-ophthalmologic function as measured by the King-Devick test (KDT) and oculomotor function as measured by the near point of convergence. In this randomized clinical trial, adult soccer players were randomized into either a heading group or kicking (control) group. The heading group executed 10 headers with soccer balls projected at a speed of 25 mph. The kicking-control group followed the same protocol but with 10 kicks. Peak linear and rotational head accelerations were assessed with a triaxial accelerometer. The KDT speed and error and near point of convergence were assessed at baseline (preheading or prekicking) and at 0, 2, and 24 hours after heading or kicking. Ten soccer-ball headings or kicks. The primary outcome was the group-by-time interaction of KDT speed at 0 hours after heading or kicking. The secondary outcomes included KDT speed at 2 hours and 24 hours after heading or kicking, KDT error, and near point of convergence.

As the detrimental effects of hypoxia are partly related to the induction of an immunosuppressive microenvironment, we investigated the interaction between tumor hypoxia dynamics and the PD-1/PD-L1 axis in HNSCC patients undergoing chemoradiation and its relevance for patient outcomes in a prospective trial. Methods: 49 patients treated with definitive chemoradiation for locally advanced HNSCC were enrolled in this trial and received longitudinal hypoxia PET imaging using fluorine-18 misonidazole ([ 18 F]FMISO) at weeks 0, 2 and 5 during treatment. Pre-therapeutic tumor biopsies were immunohistochemically analyzed regarding the PD-1/PD-L1 expression both on immune cells and on tumor cells, and potential correlations between the PD-1/PD-L1 axis and tumor hypoxia dynamics during chemoradiation were assessed using Spearman's rank correlations. Hypoxia dynamics during treatment were quantified by subtracting the standardized uptake value (SUV) index at baseline from the SUV values at weeks 2 or 5, whereby SUV index was defined as ratio of maximum tumor [ 18 F]FMISO SUV to mean SUV in the contralateral sternocleidomastoid muscle (i.e. tumor-to-muscle ratio).

Results: Neither PD-L1 nor PD-1 expression levels on tumor-infiltrating immune cells influenced LRC (HR = 0.734; p = 0.480 for PD-L1, HR = 0.991; p = 0.989 for PD-1), PFS (HR = 0.813; p = 0.597 for PD-L1, HR = 0.796; p = 0.713 for PD-1) or OS (HR = 0.698; p = 0.405 for PD-L1, HR = 0.315; p = 0.265 for PD-1). However, patients with no hypoxia resolution between weeks 0 and 2 and PD-L1 expression on tumor cells, quantified by a tumor proportional score (TPS) of at least 1%, showed significantly worse LRC (HR = 3.374, p = 0.022) and a trend towards reduced PFS (HR = 2.752, p = 0.052). In the multivariate Cox regression analysis, the combination of absent tumor hypoxia resolution and high tumoral PD-L1 expression remained a significant prognosticator for impaired LRC (HR = 3.374, p = 0.022). On the other side, tumoral PD-L1 expression did not compromise the outcomes of patients whose tumor-associated hypoxia declined between week 0 and 2 during chemoradiation (LRC: HR = 1.186, p = 0.772, PFS: HR = 0.846, p = 0.766). Conclusion: In this exploratory analysis, we showed for the first time that patients with both persistent tumor-associated hypoxia during treatment and PD-L1 expression on tumor cells exhibited a worse outcome, while the tumor cells' PD-L1 expression did not influence the outcomes of patients with early tumor hypoxia resolution. While the results have to be validated in an independent cohort, these findings form a foundation to investigate the combination of hypoxic modification and immune checkpoint inhibitors for the unfavorable subgroup, moving forward towards personalized radiation oncology treatment.", "labels": [[113, 190, "Patient"], [0, 71, "Intervention"], [93, 109, "Outcome"], [193, 216, "Intervention"], [232, 250, "Outcome"], [254, 291, "Patient"], [300, 348, "Intervention"], [362, 383, "Outcome"], [541, 587, "Intervention"], [591, 631, "Patient"], [707, 781, "Patient"], [823, 938, "Intervention"], [1655, 1810, "Outcome"], [1575, 1651, "Intervention"], [3171, 3452, "TOREMOVE"]]}

The patients underwent LLLT at 1, 5, 10, and 14 days, postoperatively. The blink test was performed to assess the function of the trigeminal nerve, and the 2-point discrimination (TPD) test was performed to assess the recovery of the inferior alveolar nerve (IAN) and the infraorbital nerves at 30 and 90 days, postoperatively. Data were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test (alpha = 0.05). Six women and 6 men were evaluated (mean age = 23.41 ± 5.03 years).

Takotsubo Syndrome(TTS), contrary to historical reports, is now increasingly recognised to be associated with substantial mortality and morbidity, both in the short- and long-term. Although TTS is often precipitated by a catecholamine pulse, in-hospital hypotension is a common occurrence, increasing the risk of mortality. Furthermore, despite the transient catecholamine stimulus, there is increasing evidence that there are significant long term sequelae, including persistently impaired left ventricular(LV) systolic dysfunction, myocardial oedema with fibrosis, as well as persistent impairment of quality of life. A definitive therapeutic option to limit the extent of initial myocardial injury, and to accelerate recovery in TTS is therefore justified. However to date, there has been a lack of prospective studies in this area. NACRAM is a multi-centre, randomised, placebo-controlled trial, sequentially testing early use of intravenous N-acetylcysteine(NAC), followed by/or oral ramipril for 12 weeks. The rationale for utilising these agents is related to their effects on limiting nitrosative stress and expression of the inflammasome activator thioredoxin interacting protein(TXNIP); both processes fundamental to the pathogenesis of TTS. NACRAM is assessing resolution of myocardial oedema on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging(CMR), improvements in LV systolic function as measured by global longitudinal strain(GLS) on echocardiography, quality of life, and inflammatory markers.

Rationale: To test whether novel biomarkers, such as microribonucleic acids (miRNAs), and nonstandard predictive models, such as decision tree learning, provide useful information for medical decision-making in patients on hemodialysis (HD). Methods: Samples from patients with end-stage renal disease receiving HD included in the AURORA trial were investigated (n=810). The study included two independent phases: phase I (matched cases and controls, n=410) and phase II (unmatched cases and controls, n=400).

Linear mixed models were used to evaluate the effects of the intervention on primary and secondary outcomes in an intention-to-treat analysis. Data from 164 (77.4%) of the 212 originally enrolled participants were available and analyzed (80 in the intervention group and 84 in the control group).

A paired t-test was used to compare mean values, a chi 2  test was used to compare proportions, and a Pearson correlation test was used to examine correlations between variables. When ice was used, buccal injection VAS pain was rated lower (p = 0.044), and VAS discomfort was rated higher (p = 0.001), in comparison to when lidocaine 5% gel was used. There was no significant difference in relative heart rate change between ice and lidocaine 5% gel at either needle stick or injection. Lidocaine 5% gel produced a relative heart rate reduction after palatal injection (0.99 ± 0.06) while buccal injection produced an increased relative heart rate (1.02 ± 0.08) (p = 0.010). Unpleasant taste was more frequently reported when lidocaine 5% gel was used (p = 0.025).

Anti-tuberculous therapy (ATT) alone cannot easily cure spine tuberculosis (STB) though it is the most essential treatment. Many studies have confirmed the efficacy of the surgical treatment of STB through anterior, anterolateral, posterior debridement, and intervertebral fusion or combined with internal fixation. However, the conventional surgical approach requires extensive exposure of the affected areas with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Recently, minimally invasive surgery has come into use to reduce iatrogenic trauma and relevant complications. Here, we introduced a novel technique for the treatment of thoracic and lumbar spine tuberculosis: minimally invasive far lateral debridement and posterior instrumentation (MI-FLDPI). In this study, we evaluated the technical feasibility, the clinical outcomes, and the postoperative complications. We did a prospective, non-randomized study on this new technique. Twenty three patients (13 males) with thoracic or lumbar spine tuberculosis who underwent minimally invasive far lateral debridement and posterior instrumentation were included in the study. The preoperative comorbidities, operation duration, intra-operative hemorrhage, Cobb's angles, and postoperative complications were recorded and analyzed. Clinical outcomes were evaluated by Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), neurological recovery, and eradication of tuberculosis. Radiological outcomes were evaluated by changes in Cobb's angle and fusion status of the affected segments. The patients were followed for an average of 19 months (ranging from 12 to 36 months). At the final follow-up, CRP and ESR of all patients were normal. The VAS and ODI were significantly improved compared with preoperative values (P < 0.05). No evident progression of the kyphotic deformity was found after surgery. Twenty two patients showed spontaneous peripheral interbody fusion 1 year after surgery. There were no failure of the instrumentation even though a young female with drug-resistant tuberculosis showed no sign of interbody fusion at the third year follow-up. All the patients with preoperative neurological deficit showed complete recovery at the final follow-up. MI-FLDPI using expandable tubular retractor could be recommended to treat thoracic and lumbar spine tuberculosis for the advantages of less trauma, earlier recovery, and less complications.

We have previously reported that in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) consumption of a very low carbohydrate diet capable of inducing nutritional ketosis over 2 years (continuous care intervention, CCI) resulted in improved body weight, glycemic control, and multiple risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) with the exception of an increase in low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). In the present study, we report the impact of this intervention on markers of risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD), with a focus on lipoprotein subfraction particle concentrations as well as carotid-artery intima-media thickness (CIMT). Analyses were performed in patients with T2D who completed 2 years of this study (CCI; n = 194; usual care (UC): n = 68). Lipoprotein subfraction particle concentrations were measured by ion mobility at baseline, 1, and 2 years and CIMT was measured at baseline and 2 years. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to assess changes in independent clusters of lipoprotein particles. At 2 years, CCI resulted in a 23% decrease of small LDL IIIb and a 29% increase of large LDL I with no change in total LDL particle concentration or ApoB. The change in proportion of smaller and larger LDL was reflected by reversal of the small LDL subclass phenotype B in a high proportion of CCI participants (48.1%) and a shift in the principal component (PC) representing the atherogenic lipoprotein phenotype characteristic of T2D from a major to a secondary component of the total variance. The increase in LDL-C in the CCI group was mainly attributed to larger cholesterol-enriched LDL particles. CIMT showed no change in either the CCI or UC group. Consumption of a very low carbohydrate diet with nutritional ketosis for 2 years in patients with type 2 diabetes lowered levels of small LDL particles that are commonly increased in diabetic dyslipidemia and are a marker for heightened CVD risk. A corresponding increase in concentrations of larger LDL particles was responsible for higher levels of plasma LDL-C. The lack of increase in total LDL particles, ApoB, and in progression of CIMT, provide supporting evidence that this dietary intervention did not adversely affect risk of CVD.", "labels": [[51, 89, "Outcome"], [93, 122, "Patient"], [28, 47, "Intervention"], [589, 774, "Outcome"], [213, 328, "Intervention"], [803, 856, "Patient"], [898, 1161, "Outcome"], [1820, 2066, "TOREMOVE"]]}

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is widely prevalent, associated with morbidity and mortality, but may be lessened with timely implementation of evidence-based strategies including blood pressure (BP) control. Nonetheless, an evidence-practice gap persists. We synthesize the evidence for clinician-facing interventions to improve hypertension management in CKD patients in primary care. Electronic databases and related publications were queried for relevant studies. We used a conceptual model to address heterogeneity of interventions. We conducted a quantitative synthesis of interventions on blood pressure (BP) outcomes and a narrative synthesis of other CKD relevant clinical outcomes. Planned subgroup analyses were performed by (1) study design (randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or nonrandomized studies (NRS)); (2) intervention type (guideline-concordant decision support, shared care, pharmacist-facing); and (3) use of behavioral/implementation theory. Of 2704 manuscripts screened, 73 underwent full-text review; 22 met inclusion criteria. BP target achievement was reported in 15 and systolic BP reduction in 6 studies. Among RCTs, all interventions had a significant effect on BP control, (pooled OR 1.21; 95% CI 1.07 to 1.38). Subgroup analysis by intervention type showed significant effects for guideline-concordant decision support (pooled OR 1.19; 95% CI 1.12 to 1.27) but not shared care (pooled OR 1.71; 95% CI 0.96 to 3.03) or pharmacist-facing interventions (pooled OR 1.04; 95% CI 0.82 to 1.34).

The aim of this preregistered, secondary analysis of a pilot randomized controlled trial (NCT02717429) was to compare the impact of 4-week mindfulness-based training and adaptive cognitive training, with a waitlist control condition, on processing speed and working memory in people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS). Sixty-one PwMS were randomized to mindfulness-based training (MBT), adaptive computerized cognitive training (aCT), or a waitlist (WL) control group and completed the Brief Repeatable Battery of Neuropsychological Tests at pre- and posttraining. Training-related changes on the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) and the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT) were the primary outcomes of interest. Baseline cognitive status was examined as a moderator of treatment gains. Practice time, change in aCT game difficulty, and rate of change in state awareness across MBT were assessed as correlates of cognitive gains. Compared with aCT and WL, mindfulness training significantly improved processing speed (ηp² = .14). Baseline cognitive status did not moderate change in processing speed (ηp² = .005) or working memory (ηp² = .014). Practice time and change in game difficulty were not significantly correlated with cognitive gains (all ps > .49). In the MBT group, rate of change in awareness was significantly associated with improvement in working memory (ρ = .52, p = .04). In PwMS, 4 weeks of mindfulness meditation training improved processing speed above and beyond aCT and WL.

People with multiple sclerosis have problems with memory and attention. The effectiveness of cognitive rehabilitation has not been established. The objectives were to assess the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a cognitive rehabilitation programme for people with multiple sclerosis. This was a multicentre, randomised controlled trial in which participants were randomised in a ratio of 6 : 5 to receive cognitive rehabilitation plus usual care or usual care alone. Participants were assessed at 6 and 12 months after randomisation. The trial was set in hospital neurology clinics and community services. Participants were people with multiple sclerosis who had cognitive problems, were aged 18-69 years, could travel to attend group sessions and gave informed consent. The intervention was a group cognitive rehabilitation programme delivered weekly by an assistant psychologist to between four and six participants for 10 weeks. The primary outcome was the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale - Psychological subscale at 12 months. Secondary outcomes included results from the Everyday Memory Questionnaire, the 30-Item General Health Questionnaire, the EuroQol-5 Dimensions, five-level version and a service use questionnaire from participants, and the Everyday Memory Questionnaire - relative version and the Modified Carer Strain Index from a relative or friend of the participant. Of the 449 participants randomised, 245 were allocated to cognitive rehabilitation (intervention group) and 204 were allocated to usual care (control group). Of these, 214 in the intervention group and 173 in the control group were included in the primary analysis. There was no clinically important difference in the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale - Psychological subscale score between the two groups at the 12-month follow-up (adjusted difference in means -0.6, 95% confidence interval -1.5 to 0.3; p = 0.20).

Cognitive (or mental processing) problems, particularly those affecting memory and attention, are common in people with multiple sclerosis. Multiple sclerosis is a condition that affects the brain and causes nerve damage. Cognitive rehabilitation can involve: retraining cognitive skills, which are the core skills your brain uses to think, read, learn, remember, reason and concentrateteaching strategies to cope in daily life. Cognitive rehabilitation is rarely provided for people with multiple sclerosis. A trial was carried out to determine whether or not providing a group cognitive rehabilitation programme improved quality of life more than usual clinical care, which did not involve any cognitive rehabilitation. The effects on daily memory problems, mood, fatigue and employment were examined and also the cost-effectiveness of the treatment. A total of 449 people with multiple sclerosis took part in the trial. They all agreed to be part of the research trial, had cognitive problems, were aged 18–69 years and could travel to attend group sessions. Participants were then allocated to receive cognitive rehabilitation or not, on the basis of chance (i.e. randomly). All participants were followed up for 1 year. Although both groups showed no differences in quality of life after 1 year, those who received cognitive rehabilitation had fewer memory problems in daily life and reported better mood than those who received only their usual clinical care. There were no differences in their levels of fatigue or disability, or in employment status. The qualitative results indicated that participants found the intervention useful. Treatment cost slightly less than usual care but had modest benefits.

The preliminary report of the RECOVERY large randomised controlled trial indicated a promising survival effect for dexamethasone therapy of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This study aimed to investigate the anti-hypoxic activities of dexamethasone to understand a possible mechanism of its action in hypoxia-induced lethality through experimental models of hypoxia. In this investigation, 84 Male BALB/c mice were randomly divided into groups of seven (12 groups). Treatment groups received 10 days of dexamethasone intraperitoneal injection at both human dose (~0.1 mg/kg) and the animal does (~1 mg/kg). Control negative and positive groups were treated with 10 ml/kg of normal saline and 30 mg/kg of propranolol, respectively. Three experimental models of hypoxia, asphyctic, circulatory, and hemic were applied in this study. The findings showed that dexamethasone significantly prolonged the latency for death in the asphyctic model concerning the control group in both humans (P < .0001) and animal dose (P < .0001). The results were also highly significant for both doses in the hemic model (P < .001). In the circulatory model, although a small increase was observed in death prolongation, results were not statistically significant for both doses in this model (P > .05). This experimental in vivo investigation demonstrated an excellent protective effect for 10 days of dexamethasone treatment against hypoxia, especially in asphyctic and hemic models. In addition to promising dexamethasone outcomes, using propranolol as the positive control illustrated a very substantial anti-hypoxic effect even much better than dexamethasone in all models.

However, no randomised controlled trials are available to guide optimal management. We therefore aimed to assess whether an intensive systolic blood pressure target resulted in reduced rates of intraparenchymal haemorrhage compared with a standard systolic blood pressure target. We did a multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial at four academic hospital centres in France. Eligible individuals were adults (aged ≥18 years) with an acute ischaemic stroke due to a large-vessel occlusion that was successfully treated with endovascular therapy. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to either an intensive systolic blood pressure target group (100-129 mm Hg) or a standard care systolic blood pressure target group (130-185 mm Hg), by means of a central web-based procedure, stratified by centre and intravenous thrombolysis use before endovascular therapy. In both groups, the target systolic blood pressure had to be achieved within 1 h after randomisation and maintained for 24 h with intravenous blood pressure lowering treatments. The primary outcome was the rate of radiographic intraparenchymal haemorrhage at 24-36 h and the primary safety outcome was the occurrence of hypotension. Analyses were done on an intention-to-treat basis. BP-TARGET is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT03160677, and the trial is closed at all participating sites. Between June 21, 2017, and Sept 27, 2019, 324 patients were enrolled in the four participating stroke centres: 162 patients were randomly assigned to the intensive target group and 162 to the standard target group. Four (2%) of 162 patients were excluded from the intensive target group and two (1%) of 162 from the standard target group for withdrawal of consent or legal reasons. The mean systolic blood pressure during the first 24 h after reperfusion was 128 mm Hg (SD 11) in the intensive target group and 138 mm Hg (17) in the standard target group.

This study evaluates the effectiveness of a clinician guided, pedometer-driven, walking intervention for increasing physical activity and improving clinical outcomes compared to education and advice. Randomized controlled trial recruiting N = 174 adults with CLBP. Participants were randomly allocated into either a standardized care group (SG) or pedometer based walking group (WG) using minimization allocation with a 2:1 ratio to the WG. Prior to randomization all participants were given a standard package of education and advice regarding self-management and the benefits of staying active. Following randomization the WG undertook a physiotherapist guided pedometer-driven walking program for 12 weeks. This was individually tailored by weekly negotiation of daily step targets. Main outcome was the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) recorded at baseline, 12 weeks, 6 and 12 months. Other outcomes included, numeric pain rating, International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), Fear-Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire (FABQ), Back Beliefs questionnaire (BBQ), Physical Activity Self-efficacy Scale, and EQ-5D-5L quality of life estimate. N = 138 (79%) participants completed all outcome measures at 12 weeks reducing to N = 96 (55%) at 12 months.

{"id": 384, "text": "Biodegradable polymer sirolimus-eluting stents versus durable polymer everolimus-eluting stents in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (BIOSTEMI): a single-blind, prospective, randomised superiority trial. Newer-generation drug-eluting stents that combine ultrathin strut metallic platforms with biodegradable polymers might facilitate vascular healing and improve clinical outcomes in patients with acute myocardial infarction undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) compared with contemporary thin strut second-generation drug-eluting stents. We did a randomised clinical trial to investigate the safety and efficacy of ultrathin strut biodegradable polymer sirolimus-eluting stents versus thin strut durable polymer everolimus-eluting stents in patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) undergoing primary PCI. The BIOSTEMI trial was an investigator-initiated, multicentre, prospective, single-blind, randomised superiority trial at ten hospitals in Switzerland. Patients aged 18 years or older with acute STEMI who were referred for primary PCI were eligible to participate. Patients were randomly allocated (1:1) to either biodegradable polymer sirolimus-eluting stents or durable polymer everolimus-eluting stents. Central randomisation was done based on a computer-generated allocation sequence with variable block sizes of 2, 4, and 6, which was stratified by centre, diabetes status, and presence or absence of multivessel coronary artery disease, and concealed using a secure web-based system. Patients and treating physicians were aware of group allocations, whereas outcome assessors were masked to the allocated stent. The experimental stent (Orsiro; Biotronik; Bülach, Switzerland) consisted of an ultrathin strut cobalt-chromium metallic stent platform releasing sirolimus from a biodegradable polymer. The control stent (Xience Xpedition/Alpine; Abbott Vascular, Abbott Park, IL, USA) consisted of a thin strut cobalt-chromium stent platform that releases everolimus from a durable polymer. The primary endpoint was target lesion failure, a composite of cardiac death, target vessel myocardial reinfarction (Q-wave and non-Q-wave), and clinically-indicated target lesion revascularisation, within 12 months of the index procedure. All analyses were done with the individual participant as the unit of analysis and according to the intention-to-treat principle. The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02579031. Between April 26, 2016, and March 9, 2018, we randomly assigned 1300 patients (1623 lesions) with acute myocardial infarction to treatment with biodegradable polymer sirolimus-eluting stents (649 patients and 816 lesions) or durable polymer everolimus-eluting stents (651 patients and 806 lesions). At 12 months, follow-up data were available for 614 (95%) patients treated with biodegradable polymer sirolimus-eluting stents and 626 (96%) patients treated with durable polymer everolimus-eluting stents. The primary composite endpoint of target lesion failure occurred in 25 (4%) of 649 patients treated with biodegradable polymer sirolimus-eluting stents and 36 (6%) of 651 patients treated with durable polymer everolimus-eluting stents (difference -1·6 percentage points; rate ratio 0·59, 95% Bayesian credibility interval 0·37-0·94; posterior probability of superiority 0·986). Cardiac death, target vessel myocardial reinfarction, clinically-indicated target lesion revascularisation, and definite stent thrombosis were similar between the two treatment groups in the 12 months of follow-up. In patients with acute STEMI undergoing primary PCI, biodegradable polymer sirolimus-eluting stents were superior to durable polymer everolimus-eluting stents with respect to target lesion failure at 1 year. This difference was driven by reduced ischaemia-driven target lesion revascularisation in patients treated with biodegradable polymer sirolimus-eluting stents compared with durable polymer everolimus-eluting stents.

Roflumilast cream contains a PDE-4 inhibitor that is being investigated for the topical treatment of psoriasis. In this phase 2b, double-blind trial, we randomly assigned adults with plaque psoriasis in a 1:1:1 ratio to use roflumilast 0.3% cream, roflumilast 0.15% cream, or vehicle (placebo) cream once daily for 12 weeks. The primary efficacy outcome was the investigator's global assessment (IGA) of a status of clear or almost clear at week 6 (assessed on a 5-point scale of plaque thickening, scaling, and erythema; a score of 0 indicates clear, 1 almost clear, and 4 severe). Secondary outcomes included an IGA score indicating clear or almost clear plus a 2-grade improvement in the IGA score for the intertriginous area and the change in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score (range, 0 to 72, with higher scores indicating worse disease). Safety was also assessed. Among 331 patients who underwent randomization, 109 were assigned to roflumilast 0.3% cream, 113 to roflumilast 0.15% cream, and 109 to vehicle cream. An IGA score indicating clear or almost clear at week 6 was observed in 28% of the patients in the roflumilast 0.3% group, in 23% in the roflumilast 0.15% group, and in 8% in the vehicle group (P<0.001 and P = 0.004 vs. vehicle for roflumilast 0.3% and 0.15%, respectively). Among the approximately 15% of patients overall who had baseline intertriginous psoriasis of at least mild severity, an IGA score at week 6 indicating clear or almost clear plus a 2-grade improvement in the intertriginous-area IGA score occurred in 73% of the patients in the roflumilast 0.3% group, 44% of those in the roflumilast 0.15% group, and 29% of those in the vehicle group. The mean baseline PASI scores were 7.7 in the roflumilast 0.3% group, 8.0 in the roflumilast 0.15% group, and 7.6 in the vehicle group; the mean change from baseline at week 6 was -50.0%, -49.0%, and -17.8%, respectively.

Data from trials comparing JAK1 inhibitors with monoclonal antibodies, such as dupilumab, that block interleukin-4 receptors are limited. In a phase 3, double-blind trial, we randomly assigned patients with atopic dermatitis that was unresponsive to topical agents or that warranted systemic therapy (in a 2:2:2:1 ratio) to receive 200 mg or 100 mg of abrocitinib orally once daily, 300 mg of dupilumab subcutaneously every other week (after a loading dose of 600 mg), or placebo; all the patients received topical therapy. The primary end points were an Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) response (defined as a score of 0 [clear] or 1 [almost clear] on the IGA [scores range from 0 to 4], with an improvement of ≥2 points from baseline) and an Eczema Area and Severity Index-75 (EASI-75) response (defined as ≥75% improvement from baseline in the score on the EASI [scores range from 0 to 72]) at week 12. The key secondary end points were itch response (defined as an improvement of ≥4 points in the score on the Peak Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale [scores range from 0 to 10]) at week 2 and IGA and EASI-75 responses at week 16.

The optimal duration of DAPT in ACS patients treated with DES is still unclear. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to investigate a short versus a standard 12-month DAPT regimen in ACS patients undergoing new-generation DES implantation. REDUCE was a prospective, open-label, multicentre, investigator-initiated study that randomised 1,496 ACS patients after treatment with the COMBO stent to either three (n=751) or 12 months (n=745) of DAPT. The primary study endpoint was a composite of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis, stroke, target vessel revascularisation and bleeding at 12 months. No difference was observed in the demographic and clinical characteristics between the two groups, except for gender (p=0.01). At one-year follow-up, non-inferiority of three- versus 12-month DAPT in the primary endpoint was met (8.2% vs 8.4%, pnon-inferiority<0.001). The similar outcome between the two groups was confirmed at two-year follow-up (11.6% vs 12.1%, p=0.76), with no significant difference in overall mortality (3.1% vs 2.2%, p=0.27), cardiac mortality (1.8% vs 1.1%, p=0.28), stent thrombosis (1.6% vs 0.8%, p=0.16) and major bleeding (3.3% vs 4.0%, p=0.46). The results show that, among ACS patients treated with the COMBO stent, three months is non-inferior to 12 months of DAPT. However, given the numerically higher rates of mortality and ST in the three-month DAPT group, one-year DAPT should still be recommended in ACS until more information becomes available.

Optimal treatment of patients with persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) and heart failure (HF) with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and an indication for internal defibrillator therapy is controversial. Patients with persistent/longstanding persistent AF and LVEF ≤35% were randomly allocated to catheter ablation of AF or best medical therapy (BMT). The primary study end point was the absolute increase in LVEF from baseline at 1 year. Secondary end points included 6-minute walk test, quality-of-life, and NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide). Pulmonary vein isolation was the primary ablation approach; BMT comprised rate or rhythm control. All patients were discharged after index hospitalization with a cardioverter-defibrillator or cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator implanted. The study was terminated early for futility. Of 140 patients (65±8 years, 126 [90%] men) available for the end point analysis, 68 and 72 patients were assigned to ablation and BMT, respectively. At 1 year, LVEF had increased in ablation patients by 8.8% (95% CI, 5.8%-11.9%) and in BMT patients by 7.3% (4.3%-10.3%; P=0.36). Sinus rhythm was recorded on 12-lead electrocardiograms at 1 year in 61/83 ablation patients (73.5%) and 42/84 BMT patients (50%). Device-recorded AF burden at 1 year was 0% or maximally 5% of the time in 28/39 ablation patients (72%) and 16/36 BMT patients (44%). There was no difference in secondary end point outcome between ablation patients and BMT patients. The AMICA trial (Atrial Fibrillation Management in Congestive Heart Failure With Ablation) did not reveal any benefit of catheter ablation in patients with AF and advanced HF. This was mainly because of the fact that at 1 year, LVEF increased in ablation patients to a similar extent as in BMT patients. The effect of catheter ablation of AF in patients with HF may be affected by the extent of HF at baseline, with a rather limited ablation benefit in patients with seriously advanced HF.

To demonstrate the feasibility, reliability, and value of remote visits in a phase III clinical trial of individuals with Parkinson's disease. We invited individuals with Parkinson's disease enrolled in a phase III clinical trial (STEADY-PD III) to enroll in a sub-study of remote video-based visits. Participants completed three remote visits over one year within four weeks of an in-person visit and completed assessments performed during the remote visit.

In the present study, we aimed to test the previously unexplored effects of acute alcohol consumption on rumination in a hazardous drinking population. We conducted a randomised placebo-controlled laboratory study to examine the effect of low (0.4 g kg -1 ) and high doses (0.8 g kg -1 ) of alcohol on state rumination compared to placebo. Participants completed a rumination induction task prior to receiving drinks. We then measured state rumination and mood at repeated time points; 30 min, 60 min and 90 min post-drinks consumption. We found a significant decrease in state rumination in the low-dose alcohol group compared to placebo at 30 min post-alcohol consumption, but no difference was observed between the high-dose alcohol and placebo groups. Mediation analysis provided evidence for an indirect effect of alcohol on state rumination through concurrent changes in negative mood.

Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to usual diagnostic procedures for atrial fibrillation detection (control group) or additional Holter-ECG recording for up to 7 days in hospital (intervention group). Patients were stratified by centre using a random permuted block design. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients on oral anticoagulants at 12 months after the index event in the intention-to-treat population. Secondary outcomes included the number of patients with newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation in hospital and the composite of recurrent stroke, major bleeding, myocardial infarction, or death after 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02204267, and is completed and closed for participants.

The trial recruited 1,547 participants from 24 trauma centres. Neuropathic pain was measured at three and six months using the Doleur Neuropathique Questionnaire (DN4); 701 participants provided a DN4 score at three months and 781 at six months. Overall, 933 participants provided DN4 for at least one time point. Physical disability (Disability Rating Index (DRI) 0 to 100) and health-related quality-of-life (EuroQol five-dimension five-level; EQ-5D-5L) were measured. Candidate predictors of neuropathic pain included sex, age, BMI, injury mechanism, concurrent injury, diabetes, smoking, alcohol, analgaesia use pre-injury, index surgery location, fixation type, Injury Severity Score, open injury, and wound care. The median age of the participants was 51 years (interquartile range 35 to 64).

Pain severity was higher among those with neuropathic pain. Linear regression analyses found that those with neuropathic pain at six months post-injury had more physical disability (DRI adjusted mean difference 11.49 (95% confidence interval (CI) 7.84 to 15.14; p < 0.001) and poorer quality of life (EQ-5D utility -0.15 (95% CI -0.19 to -0.11); p < 0.001) compared to those without neuropathic characteristics.

This is a retrospective analysis based on a database created using data from the ARISTOTLE study. Outpatient, stable adult patients with NVAF receiving apixaban were included in this study. Data collection consisted of apixaban concentration, anti-Factor Xa activity, age, weight, creatinine, and co-medications. The database composed of 2058 patients receiving apixaban. Distribution of race, NVAF subtype, and aspirin use was fairly similar across each age quantile. Older patients received a higher number of co-medications and received the 2.5 mg apixaban dose more often as compared to younger patients (22% vs. < 1%). Linear regression demonstrated that the unadjusted slope for apixaban concentration effect on anti-Factor Xa activity was similar across each age quantile. Although, the overall adjusted linear regression analysis demonstrated that the age by concentration interaction was statistically significant, relative differences in anti-Factor Xa activity (< 8%) were not clinically meaningful. Data on apixaban concentrations and anti-Factor Xa activity from a pivotal randomized double-blind study of apixaban for the prevention of stroke in NVAF patients have confirmed that the chromogenic anti-Factor Xa activity assay can accurately assess apixaban concentrations in patients regardless of age.

Although VD supplementation is suggested as a protective and immunomodulation factor for MS patients, the molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Given that VD may modulate the immune system of MS patients through the DNA repair pathway, we aimed to evaluate the effects of VD supplementation in DNA repair genes expression including OGG1, MYH, MTH1, and ITPA. Transcript levels were measured using the RT-qPCR method in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) patients before and after two months of VD supplementation. Furthermore, in silico analysis and correlation gene expression analysis was performed to find the biological binding sites and the effect of NRF2 on the regulation of DNA repair genes. Our data revealed that in MS patients, 2-month VD treatment significantly altered the expression of MYH, OGG1, MTH1, and NRF2 genes. A significant correlation was observed between DNA repair genes and NRF2 expression, which was confirmed by the presence of antioxidant response element (ARE) binding sites in the promoter of OGG1, MYH, and MTH1 genes.

The eight-gene signature was further proven to be independent of other clinic-pathologic parameters via the Cox regression analyses. Moreover, ROC analysis demonstrated that this signature owned a better predictive power of PBT prognosis.

The time taken for fixation of the plate after fracture reduction and postoperative outcomes and complications were compared between the groups. The trapezoidal plates were superior in terms of ease of adaptation and time taken for fixation (P= 0.0001). Plate fracture was observed only in the two miniplates group, in four (16%) patients. Outcomes were similar in the two groups in terms of occlusion, mouth opening, protrusion, and lateral excursion. In conclusion, both systems - two miniplates and the trapezoidal plate - provide functionally stable fixation. The outcome was significantly better for the trapezoidal plate than for two miniplates regarding the time taken for insertion and ease of adaptation, but not for other parameters.", "labels": [[449, 475, "Intervention"], [557, 592, "Patient"], [1125, 1235, "TOREMOVE"], [369, 445, "Control"], [676, 796, "Outcome"]]}

A prospective randomized clinical study with well-structured inclusion and exclusion criteria was carried out. Patients were allocated into Group A (Miniplates) and Group B (3-D Plates). The primary outcome variables were time taken for fixation, maximum mouth opening, occlusal stability, increase in angulation, and increase in the gap between fractured segments in the radiograph. The secondary outcome variables were needed for intermaxillary fixation (IMF) with guiding elastics and jaw movements. Statistical analysis was done using χ 2  test and student's t test with P value less than 0.05 indicating statistical significance. Forty-four patients (40 male and 4 female) were enrolled, with 22 patients in each group. Time taken for fixation using 3-D plates was significantly lower than conventional miniplates (9.6 ± 0.9 minutes with P value 0.001). Although clinical parameters showed improved results for Group B, there was no statistical significance.

Thus, we conducted a randomised controlled trial to discern the effects of spirulina supplementation on anthropometric indices, blood pressure, sleep quality, mood, fatigue status and quality of life among ulcerative colitis patients. Eighty participants with ulcerative colitis were randomly allocated to receive, either, 1 g/day (two 500 mg capsules) spirulina (n = 40) or placebo (n = 40), in a clinical trial for eight weeks. Dietary intake, physical activity, sleep quality, mental health, fatigue status and quality of life were assessed for each participant at baseline and trial cessation. Anthropometric indices and blood pressure were also assessed. Seventy-three participants completed the intervention.

BI 695501 is a biosimilar that has demonstrated similar efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity to adalimumab reference product in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and chronic plaque psoriasis. The VOLTAIRE-CD study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of BI 695501 with adalimumab reference product in patients with Crohn's disease. This phase 3, randomised, double-blind study was done at 92 centres in 12 countries across Europe and the USA in patients aged 18-80 years with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease (Crohn's Disease Activity Index [CDAI] score 220-450). Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 using an interactive response technology system to the BI 695501 group or adalimumab reference product group, stratified by previous exposure to infliximab (yes vs no) and simple endoscopic score for Crohn's disease at screening (<16 vs ≥16). All investigators involved in trial assessments or procedures and all patients were masked to treatment allocation until week 24. Patients received BI 695501 (40 mg/0·8 mL formulation) or adalimumab reference product (either 40 mg/0·4 mL citrate-free or 40 mg/0·8 mL) 160 mg on day 1 and 80 mg on day 15, followed by 40 mg every 2 weeks, via subcutaneous injection. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with clinical response (CDAI decrease ≥70 points) at week 4, with an exploratory non-inferiority margin of 0·76 for the lower limit of the two-sided 90% CI of the risk ratio (RR). The primary analysis was done in a modified full analysis set of all patients who received at least one dose of study medication and had a baseline and at least one post-baseline CDAI assessment. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study medication. After week 4, responders were treated until week 46; those randomly assigned to adalimumab reference product switched to BI 695501 at week 24.

Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) is a serious complication after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. There are no well-established treatment options for cGVHD after primary steroid-based treatment. Ibrutinib showed clinical benefit with an acceptable safety profile in steroid-dependent/refractory cGVHD patients in a Phase 1b/2 study (PCYC-1129-CA, NCT02195869), with which it was approved in the United States for adult cGVHD patients after failure of ≥1 systemic treatments. This open-label, single-arm, multicenter study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of ibrutinib in Japanese patients ≥12 years of age with steroid-dependent/refractory cGVHD (NCT03474679). Patients were assessed on the basis of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Consensus Development Project Criteria for Clinical Trials in cGVHD (2014). All patients received ibrutinib at a dose of 420 mg orally once daily, with a dose reduction to 280 mg/d on the concomitant use of voriconazole. Nineteen patients, including 1 adolescent, were enrolled and treated with ibrutinib in the study. At the time of clinical data cutoff (when the last patient completed the efficacy assessment at week 37), 10 of 19 patients (52.6%) remained on treatment whereas 9 of 19 patients (47.4%) had discontinued ibrutinib. The median duration of ibrutinib treatment was 9.63 (range 0.6 to 16.7+) months. The best overall response rate was 73.7%, and the rate of sustained response for ≥20 weeks was 71.4% for the responders (52.6% of all patients). Responses were seen across all the involved organs for cGVHD. Median daily corticosteroid dose requirement decreased by 0.06 mg/kg/d from baseline to week 36, whereas an improvement in the Lee cGVHD Symptom Scale score was observed in 42.1% of patients. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were pneumonia and stomatitis (36.8% each), upper respiratory tract infection (31.6%), cellulitis and platelet count decreased (26.3% each), and nausea (21.1%). Furthermore, 11 of 19 patients (57.9%) were reported with ≥1 treatment-emergent serious adverse events; the most common being pneumonia (26.3%) and cellulitis (15.8%). In total, 4 of 19 patients (21.1%) died during the study, of which 3 of 19 patients (15.8%) had TEAEs leading to death whereas 1 patient died of peritonitis, which occurred >30 days after the last dose of ibrutinib. Treatment-emergent adverse events leading to ibrutinib discontinuation were reported in 3 of 19 patients (15.8%). Ibrutinib was rapidly absorbed with a median time to reach maximum plasma concentration (tmax) of ~4.0 hours.

Thus, this study aimed to investigate the influence of weight reduction on AF ablation outcomes. SORT-AF is an investigator-sponsored, prospective, randomized, multicentre, and clinical trial. Patients with symptomatic AF (paroxysmal or persistent) and body mass index (BMI) 30-40 kg/m2 underwent AF ablation and were randomized to either weight-reduction (group 1) or usual care (group 2), after sleep-apnoea-screening and loop recorder (ILR) implantation. The primary endpoint was defined as AF burden between 3 and 12 months after AF ablation. Overall, 133 patients (60 ± 10 years, 57% persistent AF) were randomized to group 1 (n = 67) and group 2 (n = 66), respectively. Complications after AF-ablation were rare (one stroke and no tamponade). The intervention led to a significant reduction of BMI (34.9 ± 2.6-33.4 ± 3.6) in group 1 compared to a stable BMI in group 2 (P < 0.001). Atrial fibrillation burden after ablation decreased significantly (P < 0.001), with no significant difference regarding the primary endpoint between the groups (P = 0.815, odds ratio: 1.143, confidence interval: 0.369-3.613). Further analyses showed a significant correlation between BMI and AF recurrence for patients with persistent AF compared with paroxysmal AF patients (P = 0.032). The SORT-AF study shows that AF ablation is safe and successful in obese patients using continuous monitoring via ILR. Although the primary endpoint of AF burden after ablation did not differ between the two groups, the effects of weight loss and improvement of exercise activity were beneficial for obese patients with persistent AF demonstrating the relevance of life-style management as an important adjunct to AF ablation in this setting.

The initial study concluded that a 6-month home-based mobile CR programme was safe and beneficial in improving VO2peak when compared with no CR. To assess whether a 6-month guided mobile CR programme is a cost-effective therapy for elderly patients who decline participation in CR. Patients were enrolled in a multicentre randomised clinical trial from November 11, 2015, to January 3, 2018, and follow-up was completed on January 17, 2019, in a secondary care system with 6 cardiac institutions across 5 European countries. A total of 179 patients who declined participation in centre-based CR and met the inclusion criteria consented to participate in the European Study on Effectiveness and Sustainability of Current Cardiac Rehabilitation Programs in the Elderly trial. The data of patients (n = 17) that were lost in follow-up were excluded from this analysis. The intervention (n = 79) consisted of 6 months of mobile CR programme with telemonitoring, and coaching based on motivational interviewing to stimulate patients to reach exercise goals. Control patients did not receive any form of CR throughout the study period. The costs considered for the cost-effectiveness analysis of the RCT are direct costs 1) of the mobile CR programme, and 2) of the care utilisation recorded during the observation time from randomisation to the end of the study. Costs and outcomes (utilities) were compared by calculation of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. The healthcare utilisation costs (P = 0.802) were not significantly different between the two groups. However, the total costs were significantly higher in the intervention group (P = 0.040). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for the primary endpoint VO2peak at 6 months was €1085 per 1-unit [ml/kg/min] improvement in change VO2peak and at 12 months it was €1103 per 1 unit [ml/kg/min] improvement in change VO2peak. Big differences in the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for the primary endpoint VO2peak at 6 months and 12 months were present between the adherent participants and the non-adherent participants.

This multi-centre, quality improvement initiative reviewed all Code STEMI patients from the emergency department (ED) over a one-year baseline and one-year intervention period. We measured ETA time, from the first ED ECG to the time a Code STEMI was activated. Our intervention strategy involved a grand rounds presentation and an internal website presenting weekly local challenging cases, along with literature on STEMI-equivalents and subtle occlusions. Our outcome measure was ETA time for culprit lesions, our process measure was website views/visits, and our balancing measure was the percentage of Code STEMIs without culprit lesions. There were 51 culprit lesions in the baseline period, and 64 in the intervention period. Median ETA declined from 28.0 min (95% confidence interval [CI] 15.0-45.0) to 8.0 min (95%CI 6.0-15.0).

However, whether wavefront progression of necrosis also occurs laterally has been disputed. We aimed to assess the transmural and lateral spread of myocardial damage after acute myocardial infarction in humans and to evaluate the impact of metoprolol on these. We assessed myocardial infarction in the transmural and lateral dimensions in a cohort of 220 acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients from the METOCARD-CNIC trial (Effect of Metoprolol in Cardioprotection During an Acute Myocardial Infarction). The patients underwent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging at 5 to 7 days and 6 months post-STEMI. On day 5 to 7 post-STEMI cardiac magnetic resonance, there was a strong linear correlation between the transmural and lateral extent of infarction (delayed gadolinium enhancement) (r=-0.88; P<.001). Six months after STEMI, myocardial scarring (delayed gadolinium enhancement) was significantly less extensive in the transmural and lateral dimensions, suggesting that infarct resorption occurs in both. Furthermore, progression in both directions occurred both in patients receiving metoprolol and control patients, implying that myocardial salvage occurs both in the transmural and the lateral direction. Our findings challenge the assumption that irreversible injury does not spread laterally.

The rate of eTICI 2c/3 at the end of the endovascular procedure was not significantly different between the 2 thrombectomy groups (64.5% [131 of 203 patients] for contact aspiration and stent retriever combined vs 57.9% [117 of 202 patients] for stent retriever alone; risk difference, 6.6% [95% CI, -3.0% to 16.2%]; adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.33 [95% CI, 0.88 to 1.99]; P = .17). Of 14 prespecified secondary efficacy end points, 12 showed no significant difference. A higher rate of successful reperfusion was achieved in the contact aspiration combined with stent retriever group vs the stent retriever alone group (eTICI 2b50/2c/3, 86.2% vs 72.3%; adjusted OR, 2.54 [95% CI, 1.51 to 4.28]; P < .001) and of near-total or total reperfusion (eTICI 2c/3, 59.6% vs 49.5%; adjusted OR, 1.52 [95% CI, 1.02 to 2.27]; P = .04) after the assigned initial intervention alone. Among patients with acute ischemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion, an initial thrombectomy technique consisting of contact aspiration and stent retriever combined, compared with stent retriever alone, did not significantly improve the rate of near-total or total reperfusion (eTICI 2c/3) at the end of the endovascular procedure, although the trial may have been underpowered to detect smaller differences between groups.

Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) associated with age and vascular risk factors is one of the leading causes of cognitive disorders as well as ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes. The pathogenesis of this disease has not been fully understood yet. The previously established association of the antibodies against the NR2 subunit of the NMDA receptor (NR2ab) with the mechanisms of SVD such as ischemia and blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, might suggest their importance in the brain damage. We studied the NR2ab serum level in 70 patients (45 females, 61.1 ± 6.3 y.o.) with different severity of cognitive impairment and MRI features of SVD and 20 healthy volunteers (12 females, 58.5 ± 6.4 y.o.). The elevated level of NR2ab was associated with subjective cognitive impairment (SCI) (p = 0.028) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (p = 0.017), Fazekas grade (F) 2 (p = 0,002) and F3 (p = 0,009) of white matter hyperintensities (WMH) and the numbers of lacunes in the cerebral white matter (less than 5) (p = 0,039). The detected increase in serum NR2ab level in patients with SCI, as well as the minimal amount of white matter lacunes, is most likely caused by hypoxia-induced endothelial damage in the early stage of SVD. Normal NR2ab values in patients with F1 WMH, the increased NR2ab level in patients with F2 and F3 WMH and those with the minimal number of lacunes can indicate that NR2bs are involved in diffuse brain damage due to hypoxia-induced loss of BBB integrity.", "labels": [[64, 93, "Patient"], [629, 715, "Patient"], [720, 739, "Outcome"], [747, 765, "Patient"], [605, 622, "Outcome"], [1324, 1577, "TOREMOVE"]]}

Melanoma therapy has changed dramatically over the last decade with improvements in immunotherapy, yet many patients do not respond to current therapies. This novel vaccine strategy may prime a patient's immune system against their tumor and work synergistically with immunotherapy against advanced-stage melanoma. This was a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase IIb trial of the tumor lysate, particle-loaded, dendritic cell (TLPLDC) vaccine administered to prevent recurrence in patients with resected stage III/IV melanoma. Patients were enrolled and randomized 2:1 to the TLPLDC vaccine or placebo (empty yeast cell wall particles and autologous dendritic cells). Both intention-to-treat (ITT) and per treatment (PT) analyses were predefined, with PT analysis including patients who remained disease-free through the primary vaccine/placebo series (6 months). A total of 144 patients were randomized (103 vaccine, 41 control). Therapy was well-tolerated with similar toxicity between treatment arms; one patient in each group experienced related serious adverse events.

Visual inspection and biopsy is the current standard of care for oral cancer diagnosis, but is subject to misinterpretation and consequently to misdiagnosis. Topically applied PARPi-FL is a molecularly specific, fluorescent contrast-based approach that may fulfill the unmet need for a simple, in vivo, non-invasive, cost-effective, point-of-care method for the early diagnosis of oral cancer. Here, we present results from a phase I safety and feasibility study on fluorescent, topically applied PARPi-FL. Twelve patients with a histologically proven oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) gargled a PARPi-FL solution for 60 s (15 mL, 100 nM, 250 nM, 500 nM, or 1000 nM), followed by gargling a clearing solution for 60 s. Fluorescence measurements of the lesion and surrounding oral mucosa were taken before PARPi-FL application, after PARPi-FL application, and after clearing. Blood pressure, oxygen levels, clinical chemistry, and CBC were obtained before and after tracer administration. PARPi-FL was well-tolerated by all patients without any safety concerns. When analyzing the fluorescence signal, all malignant lesions showed a significant differential in contrast after administration of PARPi-FL, with the highest increase occurring at the highest dose level (1000 nM), where all patients had a tumor-to-margin fluorescence signal ratio of >3. A clearing step was essential to increase signal specificity, as it clears unbound PARPi-FL trapped in normal anatomical structures. PARPi-FL tumor cell specificity was confirmed by ex vivo tabletop confocal microscopy. We have demonstrated that the fluorescence signal arose from the nuclei of tumor cells, endorsing our macroscopic findings. A PARPi-FL swish & spit solution is a rapid and non-invasive diagnostic tool that preferentially localizes fluorescent contrast to OSCC.

In BE RADIANT, patients were randomised 1:1 to bimekizumab 320 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W) or secukinumab 300 mg (weekly until Week 4, then Q4W). Three items (itching, skin pain and scaling) of the P-SIM were electronically assessed throughout the trial and were scored from 0 to 10 (none to very severe signs/symptoms/impacts). Test-retest reliability was determined using intraclass correlations. Convergent validity was assessed between P-SIM and other relevant PRO and clinician-reported outcome (ClinRO) scores. Known-groups validity was assessed by comparing mean P-SIM item scores between patient subgroups based on the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI)/Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) scores. Responsiveness was assessed via correlations between changes from baseline in P-SIM item scores and other relevant PRO and ClinRO scores. Anchor-based responder analyses and empirical cumulative distribution function (eCDF) curves determined responder thresholds. The three P-SIM items yielded high intraclass coefficients (> 0.70).

Between June 23, 2014, and March 31, 2020, 122 patients were enrolled into our study, of whom 108 with FGFR2 fusions or rearrangements received at least one dose of infigratinib and comprised the full analysis set. After a median follow-up of 10·6 months (IQR 6·2-15·6), the BICR-assessed objective response rate was 23·1% (95% CI 15·6-32·2; 25 of 108 patients), with one confirmed complete response in a patient who only had non-target lesions identified at baseline and 24 partial responses. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events of any grade were hyperphosphataemia (n=83), stomatitis (n=59), fatigue (n=43), and alopecia (n=41). The most common ocular toxicity was dry eyes (n=37). Central serous retinopathy-like and retinal pigment epithelial detachment-like events occurred in 18 (17%) patients, of which ten (9%) were grade 1, seven (6%) were grade 2, and one (1%) was grade 3. There were no treatment-related deaths. Infigratinib has promising clinical activity and a manageable adverse event profile in previously treated patients with locally advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma harbouring FGFR2 gene fusions or rearrangements, and so represents a potential new therapeutic option in this setting.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and coronary heart disease (CHD) are two chronic diseases that cause a tremendous burden. To reduce this burden, several programmes for optimising the care for these diseases have been developed. In Germany, so-called disease management programmes (DMPs), which combine components of Disease Management and the Chronic Care Model, are applied. These DMPs have proven effective. Nevertheless, there are opportunities for improvement. Current DMPs rarely address self-management of the disease, make no use of peer support, and provide no special assistance for persons with low health literacy and/or low patient activation. The study protocol presented here is for the evaluation of a programme that addresses these possible shortcomings and can be combined with current German DMPs for T2DM and CHD. This programme consists of four components: 1) Meetings of peer support groups 2) Personalised telephone-based health coaching for patients with low literacy and/or low patient activation 3) Personalised patient feedback 4) A browser-based web portal METHODS: Study participants will be adults enrolled in a DMP for T2DM and/or CHD and living in North Rhine-Westphalia, a state of the Federal Republic of Germany. Study participants will be recruited with the assistance of their general practitioners by the end of June 2021. Evaluation will be performed as a pragmatic randomised controlled trial with one intervention group and one waiting control group. The intervention group will receive the intervention for 18 months. During this time, the waiting control group will continue with usual care and the usual measures of their DMPs. After 18 months, the waiting control group will also receive a shortened intervention. The primary outcome is number of hospital days. In addition, the effects on self-reported health-state, physical activity, nutrition, and eight different psychological variables will be investigated. Differences between values at month 18 and at the beginning will be compared to judge the effectiveness of the intervention.

Neurolytic splanchnic nerve block is used to manage pancreatic cancer pain. However, its impact on survival and quality of life remains controversial. The authors' primary hypothesis was that pain relief would be better with a nerve block. Secondarily, they hypothesized that analgesic use, survival, and quality of life might be affected. This randomized, double-blind, parallel-armed trial was conducted in five Chinese centers. Eligible patients suffering from moderate to severe pain conditions were randomly assigned to receive splanchnic nerve block with either absolute alcohol (neurolysis) or normal saline (control). The primary outcome was pain relief measured on a visual analogue scale. Opioid consumption, survival, quality of life, and adverse effects were also documented. Analgesics were managed using a protocol common to all centers. Patients were followed up for 8 months or until death. Ninety-six patients (48 for each group) were included in the analysis. Pain relief with neurolysis was greater for the first 3 months (largest at the first month; mean difference, 0.7 [95% CI, 0.3 to 1.0]; adjusted P < 0.001) compared with placebo injection.

An important caveat of amoxicillin-fluoroquinolone rescue therapy is poor eradication efficacy in the presence of fluoroquinolone resistance. The study aimed to investigate the efficacies of tetracycline-levofloxacin (TL) quadruple therapy and amoxicillin-levofloxacin (AL) quadruple therapy in the second-line treatment of H. pylori infection.

The first cycle of chemotherapy consisted of S-1 monotherapy (day 1-14), followed by a 7-day rest period. Cycles 2 and 3 consisted of the following: S-1 (day 1-14) administration, followed by a 14-day rest period, and an intravenous infusion of cisplatin and docetaxel on days 1 and 15. After two cycles, S-1 was administered for up to 1 year. Thirty patients were enrolled between 2014 and 2017. Febrile neutropenia of grade 3 or higher was the most common hematological toxicity with 4 patients (13.3%). Other hematological toxicities of grade 3 or higher were as follows: neutropenia in 3 (10.0%), leukopenia in 3 (10.0%), and anemia in 2 (6.7%) patients. Most frequent non-hematological toxicity of grade 3 was anorexia (n = 4, 13.3%) and general fatigue (n = 3, 10.0%); no grade 4 non-hematological toxicities were observed. Twenty-five patients (83.3%) completed two cycles of DCS treatment and 18 (60.0%) completed subsequent S-1 treatment for 1 year. The relative dose intensity of docetaxel and cisplatin was 0.86 and that of S-1 was 0.88. The DCS regimen can be acceptable as an adjuvant chemotherapy and offers an effective postoperative treatment option for stage III gastric cancer patients.

Both the lack of investigator blinding to both intra-abdominal pressure and to method of neuromuscular blockade represent key sources of bias. Hence, this prospective, randomised, and double-blind study aimed to compare the quality of recovery (Questionnaire QoR-40) of patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy under low-pressure and standard-pressure pneumoperitoneum. We tested the hypothesis that low pneumoperitoneum pressure enhances the quality of recovery following LC.

Ruxolitinib was generally well tolerated across all risk groups, with an adverse-event (AE) profile consistent with previous reports. The most common hematologic AEs were thrombocytopenia and anemia, with highest rates of Grade ≥3 events in high-risk patients.

Intraoperative blood loss estimated from suction devices was the primary outcome. Secondary end points were perioperative outcomes, the conversion rate from one technique to the other, and complication rates with 4 months of follow up. Uterine artery closure at the origin was completed in all 90 patients (0%), whereas closure at the UL was converted to closure at the origin in 11 cases (12.2%; p < 0.001); failures were mainly associated with the presence of endometriosis (81.8% [9/11] vs 10.1% [8/79]; p < 0.001).

Thus, the aim of this study was to establish and to validate a new equation based on the 6MWT to predict V̇O2 peak in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) survivors. A total of 200 childhood ALL survivors were enrolled in this study, among which 168 participants underwent a cardiopulmonary exercise test and a 6MWT to assess their functional capacity and their cardiorespiratory fitness. In addition, participants completed a physical activity questionnaire. Participants were randomly divided in two groups to establish the equations (n = 118 (70%)) and to validate it (n = 50 (30%)). Multiple linear regression analyses were used to determine a new prediction equation for V̇O2 peak from 6MWT using clinical and specific variables related to the disease.

Patients with CNS-positive disease were further divided on the basis of morphological bone marrow involvement-either combined bone marrow and CNS involvement, or isolated CNS involvement. Endpoints were the proportion of patients with complete response at 28 days after infusion, Kaplan-Meier analysis of relapse-free survival and overall survival, and the incidence of cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity. Of all 195 patients, 66 (34%) were categorised as having CNS-positive disease and 129 (66%) as having CNS-negative disease, and 43 (22%) were categorised as having isolated CNS involvement.

This prospective, multicenter, phase II study enrolled 96 patients with newly diagnosed, unfavorable stage I or II classical HL. The patients received four cycles of dd-ABVD followed by radiotherapy. Interim PET (PET-2) was mandatory after two courses. Primary endpoints were the evaluation of dd-ABVD feasibility and activity (incidence of PET-2 negativity).

Diethylcarbamazine citrate (DEC) treatment of loiasis is complicated by adverse reactions that are correlated with the number of circulating microfilariae (mf). The cause of these reactions is unknown, but they are accompanied by a dramatic interleukin-5 (IL-5)-dependent increase in eosinophilia and evidence of eosinophil activation. To explore the role of IL-5 driven eosinophilia in post-DEC reactions, 8 adults with confirmed loiasis and <5000 mf/mL blood were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of the humanized anti-IL-5 antibody, reslizumab, (1.0 mg/kg IV) administered 3 to 7 days prior to initiation of DEC treatment (9 mg/kg/day for 21 days). The primary endpoint was the reduction in absolute eosinophil count (AEC) during the first week of DEC treatment. Baseline characteristics were comparable between the two groups. Single dose reslizumab lowered the AEC by 77% prior to initiation of DEC therapy (vs. 12% in the placebo group, P < .05). More importantly, AEC remained below baseline in the first week of DEC treatment in all subjects who received reslizumab and in none of the placebo subjects.

Trilaciclib protects haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from chemotherapy-induced damage (myeloprotection). To assess the totality of the myeloprotective benefits of trilaciclib, including analysis of several clinically relevant but low-frequency events, an exploratory composite endpoint comprising five major adverse haematological events (MAHE) was prospectively defined: all-cause hospitalisations, all-cause chemotherapy dose reductions, febrile neutropenia (FN), prolonged severe neutropenia (SN) and red blood cell (RBC) transfusions on/after Week 5.

A total of 242 patients were randomised across the three trials (trilaciclib, n = 123; placebo, n = 119). In the individual trials and the pooled analysis, administering trilaciclib prior to chemotherapy resulted in a statistically significant reduction in the cumulative incidence of MAHE compared to placebo.

In patients with diabetic foot osteomyelitis (DFO) who underwent surgical debridement, we investigated whether a short (3 weeks) duration compared with a long (6 weeks) duration of systemic antibiotic treatment is associated with noninferior results for clinical remission and adverse events (AEs). In this prospective, randomized, noninferiority pilot trial, we randomized (allocation 1:1) patients with DFO after surgical debridement to either a 3-week or a 6-week course of antibiotic therapy. The minimal duration of follow-up after the end of therapy was 2 months. We compared outcomes using Cox regression and noninferiority analyses (25% margin, power 80%). Among 93 enrolled patients (18% females; median age 65 years), 44 were randomized to the 3-week arm and 49 to the 6-week arm. The median number of surgical debridements was 1 (range, 0-2 interventions).

This study aims to assess the effectiveness of oral antibiotic prophylaxis in preventing Surgical Site Infections (SSI) in elective colorectal surgery. In a multicentre trial, we randomized patients undergoing elective colorectal resection surgery, comparing the effectiveness of OIVA versus intravenous antibiotics (IVA) regimens to prevent SSI as the primary outcome (NCT04438655).

Expectancies about symptom improvement or deterioration are reliable predictors of symptom progression and treatment outcomes (symptom resolution or symptomatic improvement) in many (non-)pharmacological studies and treatments. This study examined predictors of symptom improvement after antimicrobial therapy for persistent symptoms attributed to Lyme disease, hypothesizing particularly pre-treatment expectancies regarding symptom improvement to be predictive. A predictive study was performed on pre-treatment and post-treatment individual characteristics, including expectancies, and physical and mental health-related quality of life (HRQoL) from the PLEASE-trial comparing randomized 12-weeks of doxycycline, clarithromycin-hydroxychloroquine, or placebo following 2 weeks of intravenous ceftriaxone. At end-of-treatment (14 weeks after trial start) and follow-up (52 weeks), complete data of 231 and 170 (of initial 280) patients with persistent symptoms temporally related to a history of erythema migrans or otherwise confirmed symptomatic Lyme disease, or accompanied by B. burgdorferi IgG or IgM antibodies, were examined through hierarchical regression analyses. In addition to pre-treatment HRQoL, pre-treatment expectancies regarding symptom improvement were consistently associated with stronger physical and mental HRQoL improvements at both end-of-treatment and follow-up (95% CI range: .09;.54, p < .01 to .27;.92, p < .001).

Patients who received IL-6RAs were younger (median age of 57.5 years vs. 61.1 and 61.8 years in the steroids and combination groups, respectively). The median C-reactive protein level was > 75 mg/L, indicating a hyperinflammatory phenotype. The median daily steroid dose was 7.5 mg dexamethasone or equivalent (interquartile range: 6-14 mg); 80.8% and 19.2% received low-dose and high-dose steroids, respectively.

Given the scale of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the development of vaccines based on different platforms is essential, particularly in light of emerging viral variants, the absence of information on vaccine-induced immune durability, and potential paediatric use. We aimed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of an MF59-adjuvanted subunit vaccine for COVID-19 based on recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein stabilised in a pre-fusion conformation by a novel molecular clamp (spike glycoprotein-clamp [sclamp]). We did a phase 1, double-blind, placebo-controlled, block-randomised trial of the sclamp subunit vaccine in a single clinical trial site in Brisbane, QLD, Australia. Healthy adults (aged ≥18 to ≤55 years) who had tested negative for SARS-CoV-2, reported no close contact with anyone with active or previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, and tested negative for pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 immunity were included. Participants were randomly assigned to one of five treatment groups and received two doses via intramuscular injection 28 days apart of either placebo, sclamp vaccine at 5 μg, 15 μg, or 45 μg, or one dose of sclamp vaccine at 45 μg followed by placebo. Participants and study personnel, except the dose administration personnel, were masked to treatment. The primary safety endpoints included solicited local and systemic adverse events in the 7 days after each dose and unsolicited adverse events up to 12 months after dosing. Here, data are reported up until day 57. Primary immunogenicity endpoints were antigen-specific IgG ELISA and SARS-CoV-2 microneutralisation assays assessed at 28 days after each dose. The study is ongoing and registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04495933. Between June 23, 2020, and Aug 17, 2020, of 314 healthy volunteers screened, 120 were randomly assigned (n=24 per group), and 114 (95%) completed the study up to day 57 (mean age 32·5 years [SD 10·4], 65 [54%] male, 55 [46%] female). Severe solicited reactions were infrequent and occurred at similar rates in participants receiving placebo (two [8%] of 24) and the SARS-CoV-2 sclamp vaccine at any dose (three [3%] of 96). Both solicited reactions and unsolicited adverse events occurred at a similar frequency in participants receiving placebo and the SARS-CoV-2 sclamp vaccine. Solicited reactions occurred in 19 (79%) of 24 participants receiving placebo and 86 (90%) of 96 receiving the SARS-CoV-2 sclamp vaccine at any dose. Unsolicited adverse events occurred in seven (29%) of 24 participants receiving placebo and 35 (36%) of 96 participants receiving the SARS-CoV-2 sclamp vaccine at any dose. Vaccination with SARS-CoV-2 sclamp elicited a similar antigen-specific response irrespective of dose: 4 weeks after the initial dose (day 29) with 5 μg dose (geometric mean titre [GMT] 6400, 95% CI 3683-11 122), with 15 μg dose (7492, 4959-11 319), and the two 45 μg dose cohorts (8770, 5526-13 920 in the two-dose 45 μg cohort; 8793, 5570-13 881 in the single-dose 45 μg cohort); 4 weeks after the second dose (day 57) with two 5 μg doses (102 400, 64 857-161 676), with two 15 μg doses (74 725, 51 300-108 847), with two 45 μg doses (79 586, 55 430-114 268), only a single 45 μg dose (4795, 2858-8043). At day 57, 67 (99%) of 68 participants who received two doses of sclamp vaccine at any concentration produced a neutralising immune response, compared with six (25%) of 24 who received a single 45 μg dose and none of 22 who received placebo. Participants receiving two doses of sclamp vaccine elicited similar neutralisation titres, irrespective of dose: two 5 μg doses (GMT 228, 95% CI 146-356), two 15 μg doses (230, 170-312), and two 45 μg doses (239, 187-307). This first-in-human trial shows that a subunit vaccine comprising mammalian cell culture-derived, MF59-adjuvanted, molecular clamp-stabilised recombinant spike protein elicits strong immune responses with a promising safety profile. However, the glycoprotein 41 peptide present in the clamp created HIV diagnostic assay interference, a possible barrier to widespread use highlighting the criticality of potential non-spike directed immunogenicity during vaccine development.

{"id": "34411004", "text": "In-hospital use of ACE inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers associates with COVID-19 outcomes in African American patients. BACKGROUNDThe angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) D allele is more prevalent among African Americans compared with other races and ethnicities and has previously been associated with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pathogenesis through excessive ACE1 activity. ACE inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (ACE-I/ARB) may counteract this mechanism, but their association with COVID-19 outcomes has not been specifically tested in the African American population.METHODSWe identified 6218 patients who were admitted into Mount Sinai hospitals with COVID-19 between February 24 and May 31, 2020, in New York City. We evaluated whether the outpatient and in-hospital use of ACE-I/ARB is associated with COVID-19 in-hospital mortality in an African American compared with non-African American population.RESULTSOf the 6218 patients with COVID-19, 1138 (18.3%) were ACE-I/ARB users. In a multivariate logistic regression model, ACE-I/ARB use was independently associated with a reduced risk of in-hospital mortality in the entire population (OR, 0.655; 95% CI, 0.505-0.850; P = 0.001), African American population (OR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.249-0.779; P = 0.005), and non-African American population (OR, 0.748, 95% CI, 0.553-1.012, P = 0.06). In the African American population, in-hospital use of ACE-I/ARB was associated with improved mortality (OR, 0.378; 95% CI, 0.188-0.766; P = 0.006), whereas outpatient use was not (OR, 0.889; 95% CI, 0.375-2.158; P = 0.812). When analyzing each medication class separately, ARB in-hospital use was significantly associated with reduced in-hospital mortality in the African American population (OR, 0.196; 95% CI, 0.074-0.516; P = 0.001), whereas ACE-I use was not associated with impact on mortality in any population.CONCLUSIONIn-hospital use of ARB was associated with a significant reduction in in-hospital mortality among COVID-19-positive African American patients.FUNDINGNone.", "labels": [[101, 126, "Patient"], [1890, 2041, "TOREMOVE"], [19, 63, "Intervention"], [80, 97, "Outcome"], [627, 749, "Patient"], [776, 819, "Intervention"], [839, 869, "Outcome"], [876, 938, "Patient"]]}

NVX-CoV2373 is a recombinant severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (rSARS-CoV-2) nanoparticle vaccine composed of trimeric full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoproteins and Matrix-M1 adjuvant. The phase 2 component of our randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 1 to 2 trial was designed to identify which dosing regimen of NVX-CoV2373 should move forward into late-phase studies and was based on immunogenicity and safety data through Day 35 (14 days after the second dose). The trial was conducted at 9 sites in Australia and 8 sites in the United States. Participants in 2 age groups (aged 18 to 59 and 60 to 84 years) were randomly assigned to receive either 1 or 2 intramuscular doses of 5-μg or 25-μg NVX-CoV2373 or placebo, 21 days apart. Primary endpoints were immunoglobulin G (IgG) anti-spike protein response, 7-day solicited reactogenicity, and unsolicited adverse events. A key secondary endpoint was wild-type virus neutralizing antibody response. After enrollment, 1,288 participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 vaccine groups or placebo, with 1,283 participants administered at least 1 study treatment. Of these, 45% were older participants 60 to 84 years. Reactogenicity was predominantly mild to moderate in severity and of short duration (median <3 days) after first and second vaccination with NVX-CoV2373, with higher frequencies and intensity after second vaccination and with the higher dose. Reactogenicity occurred less frequently and was of lower intensity in older participants. Both 2-dose regimens of 5-μg and 25-μg NVX-CoV2373 induced robust immune responses in younger and older participants. For the 2-dose regimen of 5 μg, geometric mean titers (GMTs) for IgG anti-spike protein were 65,019 (95% confidence interval (CI) 55,485 to 76,192) and 28,137 (95% CI 21,617 to 36,623) EU/mL and for wild-type virus neutralizing antibody (with an inhibitory concentration of 50%-MN50%) were 2,201 (95% CI 1,343 to 3,608) and 981 (95% CI 560 to 1,717) titers for younger and older participants, respectively, with seroconversion rates of 100% in both age groups. Neutralizing antibody responses exceeded those seen in a panel of convalescent sera for both age groups. Study limitations include the relatively short duration of safety follow-up to date and current lack of immune persistence data beyond the primary vaccination regimen time point assessments, but these data will accumulate over time. The study confirmed the phase 1 findings that the 2-dose regimen of 5-μg NVX-CoV2373 is highly immunogenic and well tolerated in younger adults. In addition, in older adults, the 2-dose regimen of 5 μg was also well tolerated and showed sufficient immunogenicity to support its use in late-phase efficacy studies.

{"id": "34637450", "text": "Behavioural activation to prevent depression and loneliness among socially isolated older people with long-term conditions: The BASIL COVID-19 pilot randomised controlled trial. Older adults, including those with long-term conditions (LTCs), are vulnerable to social isolation. They are likely to have become more socially isolated during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, often due to advice to shield to protect them from infection. This places them at particular risk of depression and loneliness. There is a need for brief scalable psychosocial interventions to mitigate the psychological impacts of social isolation. Behavioural activation (BA) is a credible candidate intervention, but a trial is needed. We undertook an external pilot parallel randomised trial (ISRCTN94091479) designed to test recruitment, retention and engagement with, and the acceptability and preliminary effects of the intervention. Participants aged ≥65 years with 2 or more LTCs were recruited in primary care and randomised by computer and with concealed allocation between June and October 2020. BA was offered to intervention participants (n = 47), and control participants received usual primary care (n = 49). Assessment of outcome was made blind to treatment allocation. The primary outcome was depression severity (measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9)). We also measured health-related quality of life (measured by the Short Form (SF)-12v2 mental component scale (MCS) and physical component scale (PCS)), anxiety (measured by the Generalised Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7)), perceived social and emotional loneliness (measured by the De Jong Gierveld Scale: 11-item loneliness scale). Outcome was measured at 1 and 3 months. The mean age of participants was aged 74 years (standard deviation (SD) 5.5) and they were mostly White (n = 92, 95.8%), and approximately two-thirds of the sample were female (n = 59, 61.5%). Remote recruitment was possible, and 45/47 (95.7%) randomised to the intervention completed 1 or more sessions (median 6 sessions) out of 8. A total of 90 (93.8%) completed the 1-month follow-up, and 86 (89.6%) completed the 3-month follow-up, with similar rates for control (1 month: 45/49 and 3 months 44/49) and intervention (1 month: 45/47and 3 months: 42/47) follow-up. Between-group comparisons were made using a confidence interval (CI) approach, and by adjusting for the covariate of interest at baseline. At 1 month (the primary clinical outcome point), the median number of completed sessions for people receiving the BA intervention was 3, and almost all participants were still receiving the BA intervention. The between-group comparison for the primary clinical outcome at 1 month was an adjusted between-group mean difference of -0.50 PHQ-9 points (95% CI -2.01 to 1.01), but only a small number of participants had completed the intervention at this point. At 3 months, the PHQ-9 adjusted mean difference (AMD) was 0.19 (95% CI -1.36 to 1.75). When we examined loneliness, the adjusted between-group difference in the De Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale at 1 month was 0.28 (95% CI -0.51 to 1.06) and at 3 months -0.87 (95% CI -1.56 to -0.18), suggesting evidence of benefit of the intervention at this time point. For anxiety, the GAD adjusted between-group difference at 1 month was 0.20 (-1.33, 1.73) and at 3 months 0.31 (-1.08, 1.70). For the SF-12 (physical component score), the adjusted between-group difference at 1 month was 0.34 (-4.17, 4.85) and at 3 months 0.11 (-4.46, 4.67). For the SF-12 (mental component score), the adjusted between-group difference at 1 month was 1.91 (-2.64, 5.15) and at 3 months 1.26 (-2.64, 5.15). Participants who withdrew had minimal depressive symptoms at entry. There were no adverse events. The Behavioural Activation in Social Isolation (BASIL) study had 2 main limitations. First, we found that the intervention was still being delivered at the prespecified primary outcome point, and this fed into the design of the main trial where a primary outcome of 3 months is now collected. Second, this was a pilot trial and was not designed to test between-group differences with high levels of statistical power. Type 2 errors are likely to have occurred, and a larger trial is now underway to test for robust effects and replicate signals of effectiveness in important secondary outcomes such as loneliness. In this study, we observed that BA is a credible intervention to mitigate the psychological impacts of COVID-19 isolation for older adults. We demonstrated that it is feasible to undertake a trial of BA. The intervention can be delivered remotely and at scale, but should be reserved for older adults with evidence of depressive symptoms. The significant reduction in loneliness is unlikely to be a chance finding, and replication will be explored in a fully powered randomised controlled trial (RCT).

Local injection site reactions, select systemic symptoms, and adverse events (AEs) were recorded. Immunogenicity was assessed by measuring serotype-specific opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) titers before and approximately 1 month after each vaccination. Local reaction and systemic event rates were similar after vaccination with PCV20 or PCV13; no serious vaccine-related AEs were reported. In the PCV20 group, functional immune responses as measured by OPA were robust for all 20 serotypes included in the vaccine, with geometric mean fold rises from baseline ranging from 6.0 to 113.4. PCV20 was well tolerated in adults 60 to 64 years of age, with a safety profile consistent with historical experience of PCVs in this age group.

The authors included active participants enrolled in the longitudinal Thinking and Living With Cancer study of nonmetastatic breast cancer survivors aged 60 to 89 years (n = 262) and matched controls (n = 165) from 5 US regions. Participants completed questionnaires at parent study enrollment and then annually, including a web-based or telephone COVID-19 survey, between May 27 and September 11, 2020.

Washing hands helps prevent transmission of seasonal and pandemic respiratory viruses. In a randomized controlled trial (RCT) during the swine flu outbreak, participants with access to a fully automated, digital intervention promoting handwashing reported washing their hands more often and experienced fewer respiratory tract infections than those without access to the intervention. Based on these findings, the intervention was adapted, renamed as Germ Defence, and a study was designed to assess the preliminary dissemination of the intervention to the general public to help prevent the spread of seasonal colds and flu. This study compares the process evaluations of the RCT and Germ Defence dissemination to examine (1) how web-based research enrollment procedures affected those who used the intervention, (2) intervention usage in the 2 contexts, and (3) whether increased intentions to wash hands are replicated once disseminated. The RCT ran between 2010 and 2012 recruiting participants offline from general practices, with restricted access to the intervention (N=9155). Germ Defence was disseminated as an open access website for use by the general public from 2016 to 2019 (N=624). The process evaluation plan was developed using Medical Research Council guidance and the framework for Analyzing and Measuring Usage and Engagement Data. Both interventions contained a goal-setting section where users self-reported current and intended handwashing behavior across 7 situations. During web-based enrolment, 54.3% (17,511/32,250) of the RCT participants dropped out of the study compared to 36.5% (358/982) of Germ Defence users. Having reached the start of the intervention, 93.8% (8586/9155) of RCT users completed the core section, whereas 65.1% (406/624) of Germ Defence users reached the same point. Users across both studies selected to increase their handwashing in 5 out of 7 situations, including before eating snacks (RCT mean difference 1.040, 95% CI 1.016-1.063; Germ Defence mean difference 0.949, 95% CI 0.766-1.132) and after blowing their nose, sneezing, or coughing (RCT mean difference 0.995, 95% CI 0.972-1.019; Germ Defence mean difference 0.842, 95% CI 0.675-1.008). By comparing the preliminary dissemination of Germ Defence to the RCT, we were able to examine the potential effects of the research procedures on uptake and attrition such as the sizeable dropout during the RCT enrolment procedure that may have led to a more motivated sample. The Germ Defence study highlighted the points of attrition within the intervention.

The objective of our study was to investigate the effect of processed A. vera gel (PAG) on immunogenicity of quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine and URI in healthy adults. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was performed. This study was conducted in 100 healthy adults at a single center from September 2017 to May 2018. Subjects were randomly divided into a PAG group (n = 50) and a placebo group (n = 50). The enrolled subjects were instructed to ingest the study drug for 8 weeks. The participants received a single dose of quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine after taking the study drug for the first 4 weeks of the study. The primary endpoint was seroprotection rate against at least one viral strain at 4 weeks post-vaccination. Other outcomes were seroprotection rate at 24 weeks post-vaccination, seroconversion rate, geometric mean fold increase (GMFI) at 4 and 24 weeks post-vaccination, seroprotection rate ratio and geometric mean titer ratio (GMTR) at 4 weeks post-vaccination between PAG and placebo groups, and incidence, severity, and duration of URI. The European Committee for proprietary medicinal products (CPMP) evaluation criteria were met at least one in the PAG and placebo groups for all strains. However, there was no significant difference in the seroprotection rate at 4 weeks post-vaccination against all strains in both PAG and placebo groups. Among secondary endpoints, the GMFI at 4 weeks post-vaccination for the A/H3N2 was significantly higher in the PAG than in placebo group. The GMTR as adjuvant effect was 1.382 (95% CI, 1.014-1.1883).

In this randomized, controlled, and clinical trial, eligible patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections were randomly assigned to receive one of the two following therapeutic regimens: The intervention group was treated with high-dose IFN-β 1a (Recigen) (Subcutaneous injections of 88 μg (24 million IU) on days 1, 3, 6) + lopinavir /ritonavir (Kaletra) (400 mg/100 mg twice a day for 10 days, orally) and the control group was treated with low-dose IFN-β 1a (Recigen) (Subcutaneous injections of 44 μg (12 million IU) on days 1, 3, 6) + lopinavir /ritonavir (Kaletra) (400 mg/100 mg twice a day for 10 days, orally). A total of 168 COVID- 19 confirmed patients underwent randomization; 83 were assigned to the intervention group and 85 were assigned to the control group. Median Time To Clinical Improvement (TTIC) for cases treated with low-dose IFN-β1a was shorter than that for cases treated with high-dose IFN-β1a (6 vs 10 days; P = 0.018). The mortality rates in intervention and control group were 41% and 36.5%, respectively. The use of high-dose IFN-β 1a did not improve TTCI in hospitalized patients with moderate to severe COVID-19. Also, it did not have any significant effect on mortality reduction compared with treating with low-dose IFN-β 1a.

COVID-19, which is a disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has spread around the world since late 2019. Studies have found associations between the rising levels of TNF-α and severe COVID-19 cases. Hence, TNF-α blocking can possibly be a favorable intervention in modifying COVID-19. To this end, in order to manage pneumonia caused by COVID-19, adalimumab may potentially be considered as a potential therapeutic agent. The present study aimed to investigate the potential therapeutic role of adalimumab in treating COVID-19 cases in combination therapy with remdesivir and dexamethasone. Among the 68 patients who were included in the current randomized controlled trial, 34 were assigned to the adalimumab group and the remaining 34 were assigned to the control group. Adalimumab at a dose of 40 mg, subcutaneous for once, was used for the intervention group. Both the intervention and control groups received remdesivir, dexamethasone, and supportive care.

Hence, increased SpO2 levels in COVID-19 patients could be crucial for their quality of life and recovery. This study aimed to demonstrate that a 30-minute single session of dorsal low-field thoracic magnetic stimulation (LF-ThMS) can be employed to increase SpO2 levels in COVID-19 patients significantly. Furthermore, we hypothesized that the variables associated with LF-ThMS, such as frequency, magnetic flux density, and temperature in the dorsal thorax, might be correlated to SpO2 levels in these patients.Here we employed an LF-ThMS device to noninvasively deliver a pulsed magnetic field from 100 to 118 Hz and 10.5 to 13.1 milliTesla (i.e., 105 to 131 Gauss) to the dorsal thorax. These values are within the intensity range of several pulsed electromagnetic field devices employed in physical therapy worldwide. We designed a single-blind, sham-controlled, crossover study on 5 COVID-19 patients who underwent 2 sessions of the study (real and sham LF-ThMS) and 12 patients who underwent only the real LF-ThMS.We found a statistically significant positive correlation between magnetic flux density, frequency, or temperature, associated with the real LF-ThMS and SpO2 levels in all COVID-19 patients.

For each cohort, 7-14 subjects were enrolled to KAF156 treatment and up to 4 subjects to placebo. KAF156 at all dose levels was safe and well tolerated. Two serious adverse events were reported-both resolved without sequelae and neither was considered related to KAF156. In part 1, all participants treated with KAF156 and none of those randomized to placebo were protected against malaria infection. In part 2, all participants treated with placebo or 20 mg KAF156 developed malaria infection. In contrast, 50 mg KAF156 protected 3 of 14 participants from infection, and doses of 800, 300, and 100 mg KAF156 protected all subjects against infection. An exposure-response analysis suggested that a 24-hour postdose concentration of KAF156 of 21.5 ng/mL (90% confidence interval, 17.66-25.32 ng/mL) would ensure a 95% chance of protection from malaria parasite infection. KAF156 was safe and well tolerated and demonstrated high levels of pre- and post-CHMI protective efficacy.

Mass drug administration (MDA) with azithromycin (AZ) is being considered as a strategy to promote child survival in sub-Saharan Africa, but the mechanism by which AZ reduces mortality is unclear. To better understand the nature and extent of protection provided by AZ, we explored the profile of protection by time since administration, using data from a household-randomized, placebo-controlled trial in Burkina Faso and Mali. Between 2014 and 2016, 30 977 children aged 3-59 months received seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC) with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine plus amodiaquine and either AZ or placebo monthly, on 4 occasions each year. Poisson regression with gamma-distributed random effects, accounting for the household randomization and within-individual clustering of illness episodes, was used to compare incidence of prespecified outcomes between SMC+AZ versus SMC+placebo groups in fixed time strata post-treatment. The likelihood ratio test was used to assess evidence for a time-treatment group interaction. Relative to SMC+placebo, there was no evidence of protection from SMC+AZ against hospital admissions and deaths. Additional protection from SMC+AZ against malaria was confined to the first 2 weeks post-administration (protective efficacy (PE): 24.2% [95% CI: 17.8%, 30.1%]).

A sample of 176 clients about to start or restart ART were randomized (83 to START, 93 to usual care) at HIV clinics in the Los Angeles area. Primary outcomes included electronically monitored dose-taking adherence and HIV viral load; primary end points were months 6 and 24, with group differences examined using nonresponse-weighted means or proportions, effect sizes, and significance testing. Item nonresponse was addressed using multiple imputation. 166 (94.3%) participants started ART, of whom 124 (74.7%) were still in care at month 6, and 90 (54.2%) at month 24. In comparison to the usual care control group, the START group had higher dose-taking adherence at month 6 (86.2% vs. 71.6%, d = 0.56, p = 0.01), which was sustained through month 24 (86.0% vs. 61.1%, d =1.01, p < 0.0001).

Despite data suggesting that older adolescence is an important period of risk for HIV acquisition in Uganda, tailored HIV prevention programming is lacking. To address this gap, we developed and tested nationally, InThistoGether (ITG), a text messaging-based HIV prevention program for 18-22 year-old Ugandan youth. To assess feasibility and acceptability, and preliminary indications of behavior change, a randomized controlled trial was conducted with 202 youth. Participants were assigned either to ITG or an attention-matched control group that promoted general health (e.g., self-esteem). They were recruited between December 2017 and April 2018 on Facebook and Instagram, and enrolled over the telephone. Between 5-10 text messages were sent daily for seven weeks. Twelve weeks later, the intervention ended with a one-week 'booster' that reviewed the main program topics. Measures were assessed at baseline and intervention end, 5 months post-randomization. Results suggest that ITG is feasible: The retention rate was 83%. Ratings for the content and program features met acceptability thresholds; program experience ratings were mixed. ITG also was associated with significantly higher rates of condom-protected sex (aIRR = 1.68, p < 0.001) and odds of HIV testing (aOR = 2.41, p = 0.03) compared to the control group. The odds of abstinence were similar by experimental arm however (aOR = 1.08, p = 0.86). Together, these data suggest reason for optimism that older adolescent Ugandans are willing to engage in an intensive, text messaging-based HIV prevention programming. Given its wide reach and low cost, text messaging should be better utilized as an intervention delivery tool in low-income settings like Uganda.

This stepped-wedge cluster-randomized controlled trial aimed to determine the causal impact of immediate ART initiation on patients' healthcare expenditures in Eswatini. Fourteen healthcare facilities were randomly assigned to transition at one of seven time points from the standard of care (ART eligibility below a CD4 count threshold) to the immediate ART for all intervention (EAAA). 2261 patients living with HIV were interviewed over the study period to capture their past-year out-of-pocket healthcare expenditures.

Despite a higher frequency of HIV care visits for newly initiated ART patients, immediate ART initiation appears to have lowered patients' healthcare expenditures because they sought less care from alternative healthcare providers.

The ECHO trial randomised 7829 women to depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA-IM), the copper intrauterine device (IUD) and the levonorgestrel (LNG) implant (1:1:1) and found no clear difference in HIV incidence between these three groups. We have previously hypothesized that oligo-amenorrhoea induced by DMPA-IM may have a protective effect on HIV acquisition. The aim of this ancillary study was to assess the effects of DMPA-IM, the IUD and the LNG implant on menstrual symptoms and sexual behavior and to correlate these with HIV acquisition. At the Effective Care Research Unit (ECRU) in South Africa, of 615 women already randomised to DMPA-IM, the copper IUD and the LNG implant (1:1:1) 552 agreed to participate. Participants completed a 28-day symptom and behavior diary following their one-month ECHO trial visit and returning it at their 3-month follow-up visit. HIV acquisition data were retrieved from ECHO trial records. Of 552 women enrolled on the ancillary study, 390 (70.6%) completed their daily diary; 130, 133, and 127 received DMPA-IM, IUD, and LNG implant, respectively. Thirty-three (5.9%) of these women acquired HIV. Women on the progestin-only contraceptives were more likely to experience amenorrhoea, as expected, and were less likely to have intra-menstrual coitus than IUD users (p < 0.001 for DMPA-IM vs IUD and p = 0.002 for implant vs IUD). Overall coital frequency was highest and condom usage lowest among DMPA-IM users. Intra-menstrual coitus correlated positively, and duration of menstruation correlated negatively, with HIV acquisition, although these effects were not statistically significant (p = 0.09 and p = 0.079, respectively). Findings support the hypothesis that oligo-amenorrhoea and the associated reduced intra-menstrual coitus may mitigate the potential for an increased biological risk of HIV acquisition with DMPA-IM but more evidence is needed. Study registration number PACTR201706001651380. There have been concerns that the depot-medroxyprogesterone acetate injection (DMPA-IM) may increase the risk of getting HIV infection. However, a large multicenter randomized study, the ECHO trial, recently compared HIV incidence among women randomized to DMPA-IM, the copper intrauterine device (IUD) and the levonorgestrel (LNG) implant and found little difference in HIV risk between these methods. DMPA-IM often causes no or scanty menstruation; we hypothesized that this may have a protective effect on getting HIV, by reducing exposure to HIV during menstrual bleeding.This ancillary study was done among ECHO trial participants at one of the ECHO study sites in South Africa. The aim was to assess the effects of the three different contraceptives on menstrual symptoms and sexual behavior and to correlate these with the risk of getting HIV. The study required women to complete a 28-day daily symptom and behavior diary after their one-month ECHO trial follow-up visit.We found that fewer women had sex during their periods with DMPA-IM and the LNG implant than the copper IUD, probably because no or scanty menstruation is more common with both DMPA-IM and the implant. Although effects were not statistically significant, having sex during periods tended to have a higher risk of getting HIV and longer periods indicated a lower risk of getting HIV.We concluded that sexual behavior related to menstruation may influence HIV acquisition and may partially explain why the ECHO trial found little difference in HIV incidence between the three contraceptives assessed despite observational evidence of higher biological risk with DMPA related to immune suppression.", "labels": [[58, 73, "Outcome"], [590, 672, "Outcome"], [861, 999, "Outcome"], [1001, 1060, "Outcome"], [0, 18, "Outcome"], [22, 53, "Intervention"], [155, 160, "Patient"], [164, 282, "Intervention"], [550, 586, "Intervention"], [741, 746, "Patient"], [769, 812, "Intervention"], [1802, 2027, "TOREMOVE"]]}

This study used a randomized, between-subjects design to examine the hypothesis that SRP with a self-generation booster can improve memory for health-related information among clinically referred persons with HIV (PWH), who often have difficulty acquiring new health knowledge. A consecutive series of 41 PWH referred to a county-funded urban neuropsychology clinic were enrolled.

The primary outcome was participants' free recall of the four treatment statements after a 20-minute delay filled with nonverbal tests. PWH participants in the SRP condition were four times more likely than controls to recall at least one treatment statement at the 20-minute delay.

This is the first prospective study to evaluate the 5-year outcomes of patients with RAKI, and assess the effect of sodium bicarbonate (SB) in the long-term outcomes of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) undergoing non-emergent coronary angiography. 382 CKD stage III-IV patients undergoing elective non-emergent coronary angiography were randomized to SB (n = 192) or normal saline (NS) solution (n = 190). Incidence of RAKI, in-hospital, 1- and 5-year mortality and renal replacement therapy (RRT), and 5-year major adverse renal and cardiovascular events (MARCE) were compared between groups. Outcomes of patient with and without RAKI were compared after five-years of prospective follow-up. Multivariate predictors of RAKI and death at 5-years were determined. The use of SB did not improve the incidence of RAKI, in-hospital outcomes, survival, and freedom from RRT or MARCE after 5-years of follow-up.

Restoration of human brain function after injury is a signal challenge for translational neuroscience. Rodent stroke recovery studies identify an optimal or sensitive period for intensive motor training after stroke: near-full recovery is attained if task-specific motor training occurs during this sensitive window. We extended these findings to adult humans with stroke in a randomized controlled trial applying the essential elements of rodent motor training paradigms to humans. Stroke patients were adaptively randomized to begin 20 extra hours of self-selected, task-specific motor therapy at ≤30 d (acute), 2 to 3 mo (subacute), or ≥6 mo (chronic) after stroke, compared with controls receiving standard motor rehabilitation. Upper extremity (UE) impairment assessed by the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) was measured at up to five time points. The primary outcome measure was ARAT recovery over 1 y after stroke. By 1 y we found significantly increased UE motor function in the subacute group compared with controls (ARAT difference = +6.87 ± 2.63, P = 0.009). The acute group compared with controls showed smaller but significant improvement (ARAT difference = +5.25 ± 2.59 points, P = 0.043).

A proof-of-concept randomised controlled trial. Exercise therapy and neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) during the initial 14 days after stroke may benefit recovery of gait. We aimed to determine whether poststroke NMES of vastus medial and tibial muscles during exercise therapy is more effective than exercise therapy alone. In this proof-of-concept randomised trial patients with first-ever acute ischemic stroke and a leg paresis (40-85 years of age) were randomised (1:1) to 10 min of daily NMES + exercise therapy or exercise therapy alone. Primary outcome was the between-group difference in change in 6 min Walk Test (6MWT) at 90 days post stroke estimated with a mixed regression model. Secondary outcomes included 10 m Walk Test, Fugl-Meyer Motor Assessment, Guralnik Timed Standing Balance, Sit to Stand, Timed Up and Go, EQ-5D-5L, Montreal Cognitive Assessment and Becks Depression Inventory. 50 stroke survivors (25 in each group) with a mean age of 67 years (range 43-83) were included. An insignificant between-group difference in change of 28.3 m (95%CI -16.0 to 72.6, p = 0.23, adjusted for baseline) in 6MWT at 90-days follow-up was found, in favour of the NMES group. All secondary outcomes showed no statistically significant between-group difference. The conclusion was that adding NMES to exercise therapy had no effect on poststroke walking distance measured by the 6 MWT or any of the secondary outcomes. In this proof-of-concept RCT, we demonstrated that NMES in addition to exercise therapy during the first 14 days after onset of ischemic stroke did not improve walking distance or any of the secondary outcomes.

As shorter CGG premutation repeats are common in the population, understanding their impact on health outcomes has a potentially large public health footprint. The study's objective was to compare an unselected group of premutation carriers (n = 35, 55-101 CGG repeats) with matched controls (n = 61, 29-39 CGG repeats) with respect to FXTAS-type signs using structured neurological assessments.

People with Multiple Sclerosis (PwMS) experience a wide range of symptoms that can alter function and limit activity and community participation. Symptoms including sensory changes, weakness, fatigue and others have been well documented. However, symptoms related to changes in vestibular related function, including gaze and postural stability have not been fully explored. While some recent studies have begun to provide insight into these deficits in PwMS and have explored the use of rehabilitation paradigms for their management, much remains unknown about the full extent of these deficits. Therefore, this study aimed to characterize the presence of gaze and postural stability deficits in measures across the World Health Organization International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (WHO ICF) and to examine how deficits in domains of body structure and function and activity contribute to participation level limitations. Baseline data from 41 PwMS (mean(SD) age = 53.9(11.2), 78% female) enrolled as part of a randomized clinical trial were used in this analysis. Measures of gaze and postural stability from the ICF domains of body structure and function (Vestibular ocular reflex [VOR] gain and postural sway area), activity (computerized dynamic visual acuity [cDVA] and MiniBEST test), and participation (Dizziness handicap inventory [DHI] and Activities Balance Confidence [ABC] scale) along with demographic data were used to characterize the sample. To explore relationships between ICF domains for gaze and postural stability, univariate correlations were performed between measures from each domain using Pearson's correlations. Separate multivariate regression models examined how measures from the body structure and function and activity domains contributed to the variance in the participation level outcomes. Variance explained by the models was quantified using R-squared statistic and contribution of the independent variables were quantified using the beta coefficient (p < 0.05). Correlation analysis demonstrated significant relationships in the postural stability measures across domains. Specifically, between postural sway area on a firm surface and MiniBEST test score (r = -.48;p < 0.01) and MiniBEST test score and ABC score (r = 0.5;p < 0.01). Significant correlations were also found between the gaze stability measures of horizontal and vertical VOR gain (r = .68;p < 0.001), horizontal VOR gain and dynamic visual acuity (r = .38;p = 0.02), and vertical VOR gain and dynamic visual acuity (r = .54;p < 0.001). Regression models assessing postural stability, found that only the MiniBEST score significantly contributed to the variance in ABC score (p = 0.01) and the full model explained 34% of the variance in ABC score. Regression modeling of gaze stability outcomes did not produce any variable that significantly contributed to the variance in DHI score and the full model explained 18% of the variance in DHI score. PwMS in this sample demonstrated deficits in gaze and postural stability across the domains of the WHO ICF compared to past samples of PwMS and healthy cohorts. Correlation between measures in the different domains were present, but no strong relationship between measures of body structure and function, activity and participation level outcomes were observed. This lack of relationship across the domains is likely contributed to the relatively small sample size, the high level of variability observed in the outcomes, and the diverse presentation often seen in PwMS.", "labels": [[55, 85, "Patient"], [0, 51, "Outcome"], [715, 1037, "Outcome"], [1060, 1064, "Patient"], [1181, 1572, "Outcome"], [3228, 3428, "TOREMOVE"]]}

This multicentre, parallel group, single-blind, randomised controlled trial was conducted across two study sites in England. Participants were recruited via 16 patient identification centres, two study sites in England (Nottingham and London), or online self-referral. Eligible participants were aged 9-17 years, had Tourette syndrome or chronic tic disorder, had not received behavioural therapy for tics in the past 12 months or were about to start, and had a Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS) Total Tic Severity Score (TTSS) of more than 15 or more than 10 if they had only motor or vocal tics. Patients were excluded if they had started or stopped medication for tics within the past 2 months; had current alcohol or substance dependence, psychosis, suicidality, anorexia nervosa, or suspected moderate to severe intellectual disability; or presented an immediate risk to self or others; or the parent or carer was unable to speak, read, or write in English. Eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1) by masked outcome assessors to receive 10 weeks of online, remotely delivered, therapist-supported ERP or psychoeducation (active control). Outcome assessors, statisticians, health economists, the trial manager, and the chief investigator were masked to group allocation. Patients were not directly informed of their allocation, but this could be established from the content once treatment commenced and the patients were not, therefore, considered masked to treatment. The primary outcome was YGTSS-TTSS 3 months after randomisation, and analysis was done in all randomised patients for whom data were available for each timepoint and outcome. Safety analysis was by intention to treat. Longer term follow-up is ongoing. This trial is registered with ISRCTN (ISRCTN70758207) and ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03483493). Between May 8, 2018, and Sept 30, 2019, we assessed 445 candidates for inclusion in the study. 221 potential participants were excluded (90 did not meet inclusion criteria, 84 declined to participate, and 47 unable to contact family). 224 participants were enrolled and randomly assigned to ERP (n=112) or psychoeducation (n=112). The enrolled patients were mostly male (n=177; 79%) and of White ethnicity (n=195; 87%). 11 patients were lost to follow-up 3 months after randomisation in the ERP group, compared with 12 patients in the psychoeducation group. Mean YGTSS-TTSS at 3 months after randomisation was 23·9 (SD 8·2) in the ERP group and 26·8 (7·3) in the psychoeducation group. The mean total decrease in YGTSS-TTSS at 3 months was 4·5 (16%, SD 1·1) in the ERP group versus 1·6 (6%, 1·0) in the psychoeducation group. The estimated mean difference in YGTSS-TTSS change between the groups adjusted for baseline and site was -2·29 points (95% CI -3·86 to -0·71) in favour of ERP, with an effect size of -0·31 (95% CI -0·52 to -0·10). Two serious adverse events occurred (one collapse and one tic attack), both in the psychoeducation group, neither of which were related to study treatment.

Agitated and aggressive behaviors (behaviors) are common in nursing home (NH) residents with dementia. Medications commonly used to manage behaviors have dangerous side effects. NHs are adopting non-pharmacological interventions to manage behaviors, despite a lack of effectiveness evidence and an understanding of optimal implementation strategies. We are conducting an adaptive trial to evaluate the effects of personalized music on behaviors. Adaptive trials may increase efficiency and reduce costs associated with traditional RCTs by learning and making modifications to the trial while it is ongoing. We are conducting two consecutive parallel cluster-randomized trials with 54 NHs in each trial (27 treatment, 27 control). Participating NHs were recruited from 4 corporations which differ in size, ownership structure, geography, and residents' racial composition. After randomization, there were no significant differences between the NHs randomized to each trial with respect to baseline behaviors, number of eligible residents, degree of cognitive impairment, or antipsychotic use. Agitated behavior frequency is assessed via staff interviews (primary outcome), required nursing staff conducted resident assessments (secondary outcome), and direct observations of residents (secondary outcome). Between the two parallel trials, the adaptive design will be used to test alternative implementation strategies, increasingly enroll residents who are likely to benefit from the intervention, and seamlessly conduct a stage III/IV trial. This adaptive trial allows investigators to estimate the impact of a popular non-pharmaceutical intervention (personalized music) on residents' behaviors, under pragmatic, real-world conditions testing two implementation strategies. This design has the potential to reduce the research timeline by improving the likelihood of powered results, increasingly enrolling residents most likely to benefit from intervention, sequentially assessing the effectiveness of implementation strategies in the same trial, and creating a statistical model to reduce the future need for onsite data collection. The design may also increase research equity by enrolling and tailoring the intervention to populations otherwise excluded from research.

The contribution of walking activity to home and community mobility in PD is poorly understood. Cross-sectional baseline data (N = 69) were analyzed from a randomized controlled PD trial. The Life-Space Assessment (LSA) quantified the extent, frequency, and independence across 5 expanding levels of home and community mobility, producing individual subscores and a total score. Two additional summed scores were used to represent mobility within (Levels 1-3) and beyond (Levels 4-5) neighborhood limits. An accelerometer measured walking activity for 7 days. Regression and correlation analyses evaluated relationships between daily steps and mobility scores. Mann-Whitney U tests secondarily compared differences in mobility scores between the active and sedentary groups. Walking activity contributed significantly to the summed Level 1-3 score (β = 0.001, P = 0.004) but not to the summed Level 4-5 (β = 0.001, P = 0.33) or total (β = 0.002, P = 0.07) scores.

One of these complications is sleep disorders including insomnia disorder that can affect all aspects of personal life. The present study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) on insomnia severity and sleep quality among postmenopausal women. This was a randomised clinical trial in which 46 women were recruited and randomly allocated into two groups, one receiving CBT-I and a control group. The CBT-I group received six sessions of training, while the control group received only usual care. A demographic questionnaire, Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), were used to collect the data. The ISI and PSQI were measured at baseline, 3 and 6 weeks after intervention, and in a 4-week follow-up. The Independent t test, the chi-square test, generalised estimating equation models, and Bonferroni correction were applied to analyse the data. According to our results, in the CBT-I group compared to the control group, the mean ISI, PSQI, sleep onset latency, sleep time, and sleep quality score reduced continuously from baseline to week 3 and from week 3 to week 6, and remained constant from week 6 to week 10. The mean sleep efficiency score improved significantly from baseline to week 3 in the CBT-I group and remained unchanged until the end of the study.

This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of ultrasound-guided transmuscular quadratus lumborum block (QLB) combined with local infiltration analgesia (LIA) for pain management and recovery in patients who have undergone total hip arthroplasty (THA) via a posterolateral approach. This was a prospective, randomized controlled trial. We collected data in the preoperative area, operating room, and bed ward. A total of 80 patients with American Society of Anesthesiology functional status scores of II-III were included and assigned to two groups, and all 80 patients were included in the final analysis. All included patients were randomly assigned to the nerve block (group N) or the control group (group C). Patients in the group N received transmuscular QLB combined with LIA, while patients in the group C received only LIA. The primary outcome was postoperative pain during the first active motion: it was measured at six hours after surgery and assessed using a visual analog scale (VAS).

Chronic postoperative pain is common after breast cancer surgery. Peri-operative lidocaine infusion may prevent the development of chronic postoperative pain, but a large-scale trial is required to test this hypothesis. It is unclear whether a pragmatic, multicentre trial design that is consistent with expert guidance, addresses the limitations of previous studies, and overcomes existing translational barriers is safe, effective and feasible. We conducted a double-blind, randomised controlled pilot study in 150 patients undergoing breast cancer surgery across three hospitals in Western Australia. Patients received lidocaine, or equivalent volumes of saline, as an intravenous bolus (1.5 mg.kg -1  ) and infusion (2 mg.kg -1  .h -1  ) intra-operatively, and a subcutaneous infusion (1.33 mg.kg -1  .h -1  ) postoperatively for up to 12 h on a standard surgical ward, with novel safety monitoring tools in place. The co-primary outcomes were: in-hospital safety events; serum levels of lidocaine during intravenous and subcutaneous infusion; and annualised enrolment rates per site with long-term data capture. In-hospital safety events were rare, and similar in the placebo and lidocaine arms (3% vs. 1%).

An underlying cause of solid tumor resistance to chemotherapy treatment is diminished tumor blood supply, which leads to a hypoxic microenvironment, dependence on anaerobic energy metabolism, and impaired delivery of intravenous treatments. Preclinical data suggest that dietary strategies of caloric restriction and low-carbohydrate intake can inhibit glycolysis, while acute exercise can transiently enhance blood flow to the tumor and reduce hypoxia. The Diet Restriction and Exercise-induced Adaptations in Metastatic Breast Cancer (DREAM) study will compare the effects of a short-term, 50% calorie-restricted and ketogenic diet combined with aerobic exercise performed during intravenous chemotherapy treatment to usual care on changes in tumor burden, treatment side effects, and quality of life. Fifty patients with measurable metastases and primary breast cancer starting a new line of intravenous chemotherapy will be randomly assigned to usual care or the combined diet and exercise intervention. Participants assigned to the intervention group will be provided with food consisting of 50% of measured calorie needs with 80% of calories from fat and ≤ 10% from carbohydrates for 48-72 h prior to each chemotherapy treatment and will perform 30-60 min of moderate-intensity cycle ergometer exercise during each chemotherapy infusion, for up to six treatment cycles. The diet and exercise durations will be adapted for each chemotherapy protocol. Tumor burden will be assessed by change in target lesion size using axial computed tomography (primary outcome) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-derived apparent diffusion coefficient (secondary outcome) after up to six treatments. Tertiary outcomes will include quantitative MRI markers of treatment toxicity to the heart, thigh skeletal muscle, and liver, and patient-reported symptoms and quality of life.

We sought to characterize longitudinal PROs and cosmesis in a randomized trial comparing conventionally fractionated (CF) versus hypofractionated (HF) WBI. From 2011 to 2014, women aged ≥40 years with Tis-T2 N0-N1a M0 breast cancer who underwent a lumpectomy with negative margins were randomized to CF-WBI (50 Gray [Gy]/25 fractions plus boost) versus HF-WBI (42.56 Gy/16 fractions plus boost). At baseline (pre-radiation), at 6 months, and yearly thereafter through 5 years, PROs included the Breast Cancer Treatment Outcome Scale (BCTOS), Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast (FACT-B), and Body Image Scale; cosmesis was reported by the treating physician using Radiation Therapy Oncology Group cosmesis values. Multivariable mixed-effects growth curve models evaluated associations of the treatment arm and patient factors with outcomes and tested for relevant interactions with the treatment arm. A total of 287 patients were randomized, completing a total of 14,801 PRO assessments. The median age was 60 years, 37% of patients had a bra cup size ≥D, 44% were obese, and 30% received chemotherapy.

BACKGROUND : Bleeding after endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is a severe adverse event. Several methods to prevent post-ESD bleeding (PEB) have been introduced; however, they have not been widely used because of technical difficulties. We aimed to investigate whether polysaccharide hemostatic powder (PHP), which is very easy to apply, can prevent early post-ESD bleeding, especially in patients with a high risk of post-ESD bleeding. METHODS : This was a prospective, multicenter, randomized, open-label, controlled trial. Patients with a high risk for post-ESD bleeding were enrolled. Patients with gastric neoplasms in whom the resected specimen size was expected to be > 40 mm and those who were regularly taking antithrombotic agents were defined as high risk patients. Patients were randomly assigned to the PHP or control groups. RESULTS:  Between May 2017 and September 2018, 143 patients were enrolled (PHP group, 73; control group, 70). The total post-ESD bleeding rate was 6.3 % (PHP group, 5.5 % vs. control group, 7.1 %; P = 0.74). There was no bleeding within 7 days after ESD in the PHP group. Continued antithrombotic use was an independent risk factor for post-ESD bleeding.

This study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of anlotinib compared with placebo as third- or further-line treatment for advanced SCLC in China. A Markov model was developed to simulate the process of advanced SCLC and estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of anlotinib versus placebo. The health outcomes and utilities were derived from the ALTER1202 (NCT03059797) and published sources, respectively. Total costs were calculated from the perspective of Chinese society. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) were conducted to explore the model uncertainties. Anlotinib was estimated to result in an additional 0.12 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) at an incremental cost of $2131.32, resulting in an ICER of $17,741.94/QALY. The ICER did not exceed the willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $30,833 per QALY, which was three times the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita of China in 2019.

This secondary analysis of data from a randomized controlled pilot study involving 83 adults with overweight/obesity used descriptive statistics and Univariate ANOVAS to compare YFAS 2.0 and Weight and Lifestyle Inventory responses among the groups. Twenty-eight individuals did not meet the FA symptom criteria, 20 met the symptom, but not the impairment/distress criteria, and 35 met both criteria. Of the latter, 80.0% had severe, 8.6% had moderate, and 11.4% had mild FA. Age at onset of overweight was lower with severe than with mild FA (p = 0.023). The YFAS 2.0 identified a distinct group with severe FA and a group who met the FA symptom threshold, but not the impairment/distress criteria. Few participants perceived impairment/distress unless they endorsed ≥ 6 symptoms. Adding clinical interviews may aid in assessing impairment/distress and addictive-like eating behaviors, particularly in those meeting the FA symptom, but not the impairment/distress criteria. Better characterization of these groups may help targeting obesity interventions. NCT03431831, 1/30/2018.

The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted access to treatment for substance use disorders (SUDs), while alcohol and cannabis retail sales increased. During the pandemic, we tested a tailored digital health solution, Woebot-SUDs (W-SUDs), for reducing substance misuse. In a randomized controlled trial, we compared W-SUDs for 8 weeks to a waitlist control. U.S. adults (N = 180) who screened positive for substance misuse (CAGE-AID>1) were enrolled June-August 2020. The primary outcome was the change in past-month substance use occasions from baseline to end-of-treatment (EOT). Study retention was 84%. General linear models tested group differences in baseline-to-EOT change scores, adjusting for baseline differences and attrition. At baseline, the sample (age M = 40, SD = 12, 65% female, 68% non-Hispanic white) averaged 30.2 (SD = 18.6) substance occasions in the past month. Most (77%) reported alcohol problems, 28% cannabis, and 45% multiple substances; 46% reported moderate-to-severe depressive symptoms. Treatment participants averaged 920 in-app text messages (SD = 892, Median = 701); 96% of completed lessons were rated positively; and 88% would recommend W-SUDs. Relative to waitlist, W-SUDs participants significantly reduced past-month substance use occasions (M = -9.1, SE = 2.0 vs. M = -3.3, SE = 1.8; p = .039). Secondary substance use and mood outcomes did not change significantly by group; however, reductions in substance use occasions correlated significantly with increased confidence and fewer substance use problems, cravings, depression and anxiety symptoms, and pandemic-related mental health effects (p-value<.05).

It is a promising approach for improving participation in cardiac rehabilitation by enabling instant contact, hypermedia information delivery, technology-monitored functionalities and individualised progress monitoring. To evaluate the effects of a nurse-led eHealth cardiac rehabilitation (NeCR) system on health behaviours, cardiac self-efficacy, anxiety and depression, health-related quality of life, risk parameters and unplanned use of care services for people with coronary heart disease. A single-blinded randomised controlled trial design was used. The study randomly assigned 146 patients hospitalised for coronary heart disease to receive either the NeCR intervention or the usual care. Underpinned by social cognitive theory, the intervention commenced before hospital discharge with an in-person session by the nurse to identify individualised self-care needs, set goals and develop an action plan to enhance behavioural risk factor modification and orientate the patient to the use of the information and communication technology platform for cardiac rehabilitation. After discharge, the e-platform helped patients gain knowledge of disease management and monitor goal attainment for health behavioural changes. The nurse provided feedback on the patients' goal attainment and lifestyle modifications on a weekly basis in a small group format through the WeChat platform, thus also mobilising peer influence. Data for lifestyle behaviours, physiological risk parameters and clinical outcomes were collected at baseline and at 6 and 12 weeks post-intervention. At 6 weeks post-intervention, participants in the intervention group showed significant improvement in the number of steps/day (β = 2628.48, p = .022), the number of minutes/week sitting (β = -640.30, p = .006) and their health-promoting lifestyle profile (β = 25.17, p < .001) compared with the control group. Improvements in the number of steps/day (β = 2520.00, p = .006), the number of minutes/week sitting (β = -719.73, p = .004) and health-promoting lifestyle (β = 16.09, p < .001) were sustained until the 12-week post-intervention endpoint.

This study analyzed patient-therapist in-session interpersonal complementarity effects on the therapeutic alliance and depression severity during the initial and working phase of cognitive-behavioral therapy for depression. It also explored whether patients' interpersonal problems moderate those complementarity effects. We drew on a sample of 90 dyads derived from a randomized controlled trial of two cognitive-behavioral therapies for depression. Using an observer-based measure, we assessed patients' and therapists' interpersonal behavior in Sessions 1, 5, 9, and 13 and computed their complementarity regarding interpersonal affiliation (i.e., correspondence) and dominance (i.e., reciprocity). Patients completed measures of interpersonal problems at baseline and session-by-session measures of depression severity and quality of the therapeutic alliance. Response surface analyses based on polynomial regressions showed that patient-therapist complementarity in higher affiliative behaviors was associated with a stronger alliance. Interpersonal problems regarding agency moderated the complementarity effects of the dominance dimensions on depression severity. Overly dominant patients benefited more from a nonreciprocal relationship in the dominance dimension, whereas submissive patients benefited more from complementarity in that dimension. Furthermore, interpersonal problems of communion significantly moderated the effects of complementarity in affiliative behaviors on both the alliance and outcome. These results suggest the relevance of both interpersonal correspondence and reciprocity for the psychotherapy process, informing clinical practice in terms of interpersonal responsiveness. The moderation effects of interpersonal problems provide preliminary evidence, which should be replicated in future research, to determine relevant markers indicating for whom a complementary approach would be beneficial in cognitive therapy for depression.

Subjective quality of life is an important outcome of psychotic disorders. However, longitudinal course of subjective quality of life in the early illness stage is under-studied. We aimed to investigate the patterns and baseline predictors of subjective quality of life trajectories over 3 years in early psychosis patients, utilizing growth mixing modeling analysis, in the context of a 3-year follow-up of a randomized controlled trial comparing 1-year extension of early intervention with step-down psychiatric care for first-episode psychosis. One hundred sixty Chinese patients were recruited from specialized early intervention program for first-episode psychosis in Hong Kong after they had completed this 2-year early intervention service, and underwent 1-year randomized controlled trial as well as 2-year post-randomized controlled trial follow-up (i.e. 3-year follow-up). Assessments on premorbid adjustment, onset profile, psychopathology, functioning and treatment characteristics were conducted. Individual class membership of subjective quality of life trajectory derived from growth mixing modeling was based on the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey mental component summary scores measured at four different time-points (baseline, 1, 2 and 3 years) among 142 participants across 3-year follow-up. Three distinct subjective quality of life trajectories were identified including higher-improving (68.3%, n = 97), lower-stable (24.6%, n = 35) and deteriorating (7%, n = 10) trajectories. Age of onset; duration of untreated psychosis; depressive, positive and negative symptoms; and intervention condition were significantly different between good (higher-improving trajectory) and poor (combined lower-stable and deteriorating trajectories) trajectory groups. Multiple regression analysis revealed that younger age of onset, more severe depression and receipt of step-down care independently predicted poor subjective quality of life trajectory.

Older nursing home residents are often characterized by multimorbidity and dependency in activities of daily living. Most exercise studies in this setting aim at residents who are still able to walk despite the huge group of residents that is unable to walk. Thus, little is known about the effectiveness to improve cognitive and motor functions as well as well-being within this target group, e.g., by use of chair-based exercises. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of a 16-week multicomponent chair-based exercise intervention on motor functions, cognition and well-being for nursing home residents who are unable to walk. A two-arm single-blinded multicenter randomized controlled trial integrated N = 52 nursing home residents with a mean age of 81 ± 11 years (63% female), randomly assigned to a training (n = 26, 16 weeks; twice a week; 60 min) or a wait-list control group (n = 26). The intervention followed the F.I.T.T. principles (frequency, intensity, time and type) and was continuously adapted to residents' performance level. The outcomes motor function (hand grip strength, sitting balance, manual dexterity), cognitive performance (cognitive status, working memory) and psychosocial resources (physical and mental well-being (SF12), satisfaction with life (SWLS), depressive symptoms (CES-D)) were assessed at baseline (pre-test) and after 16-weeks (post-treatment). Statistics were performed using ANOVA for repeated measures. The results of the ANOVA showed significant improvements of the intervention group for hand grip strength (Pre: M = 12.67, SD = 5.28; Post: M = 13.86, SD = 4.79; Group × Time: F(1, 17) = 10.816, p = .002, ηp 2  = 0.241), manual dexterity (Pre: M = 4.50, SD = 5.17; Post: M = 5.30, SD = 4.25; Group × Time: F(1, 7) = 9.193, p = .008, ηp 2  = 0.365), cognition (Pre: M = 10.31, SD = 6.87; Post: M = 11.06, SD = 7.50; Group × Time: F(1, 15) = 12.687, p = .001, ηp 2  = 0.284), and depression (Pre: M = 5.19, SD = 5.12; Post: M = 4.38, SD = 4.62; Group × Time: F(1, 14) = 5.135, p = .031, ηp 2  = 0.150) while the values of the control group decreased. The multicomponent chair-based intervention over 16 weeks was able to improve motor functions and cognition in nursing home residents who are unable to walk.

Regarding clinical outcomes, patients with AUD who received active stimulation demonstrated a greater rate of improvement in depression symptoms than those without comorbid AUD. The presence of AUD did not impact PTSD symptom change. Limitations include a modest sample size and use of a categorical, rather than continuous, index of AUD diagnosis.

Predictors of membership to trajectories of suicidal ideation were identified by the convergence of four machine learning models, i.e., least absolute shrinkage and selection operator logistic regression, random forest, gradient boosting machine, and classification tree. The course of suicidal ideation was best captured by two trajectories, a favorable and an unfavorable trajectory comprising 173 and 76 participants respectively. Members of the favorable trajectory had no suicidal ideation by week 8. In contrast, members of the unfavorable trajectory had a 60% probability of suicidal ideation by treatment end. Convergent findings of the four machine learning models identified hopelessness, neuroticism, and low general self-efficacy as the strongest predictors of membership to the unfavorable trajectory of suicidal ideation during psychotherapy. Assessment of suicide risk should include hopelessness, neuroticism, and general self-efficacy as they are predictors of an unfavorable course of suicidal ideation in depressed older adults receiving psychotherapy.

It is commonly known that stored blood and blood products are heated before transfusion to prevent hypothermia, which leads to increased di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) content leaching into the blood and blood products and thereby causes greater conversion of DEHP to mono (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP). However, there has been no study in the literature reporting on the amount of toxic phthalates in blood following the erythrocyte suspension (ES) transfused via warming. In this study, we aimed to investigate the DEHP and MEHP content in blood following the heated ES transfusions administered by DEHP-containing and DEHP-free infusion sets. The study included 30 patients that were randomly divided into two groups with 15 patients each: group I underwent ES transfusion via DEHP-containing infusion sets warmed with blood-fluid warmers, and group II underwent ES transfusion via DEHP-free infusion sets warmed with blood-fluid warmers. DEHP and MEHP levels were measured both before and after transfusion. DEHP-free infusion sets led to no increase in the phthalate content, whereas DEHP-containing infusion sets significantly increased the DEHP and MEHP, where the DEHP level increased almost four times (P = .001).

The treatment result of the uncovered metallic stent (uncovered MS) and covered metallic stent (covered MS) for unresectable malignant distal biliary obstruction is controversial. This time, we conducted this study to compare the efficacies and complication rates of uncovered MS and covered MS in unresectable malignant distal biliary obstructions at a prospective randomized multicenter trial. From April 2014 to September 2018, patients with unresectable malignant distal biliary obstruction were randomly assigned to 2 groups: the uncovered MS group and the covered MS group. 92 treatment results patients were discussed. 48 patients were assigned to the uncovered MS group and 44 cases were assigned to the covered MS group. Both groups showed a drainage effect. No significant difference was found in the drainage effect between the 2 groups. The number of stent occlusion was significantly greater (p = .0467) in uncovered MS (43.8%) comparing with those in covered MS (22.7%). As the cause of stent occlusion, tumor ingrowth was significantly greater (p < .001) in the uncovered MS group (35.4%) than in the covered MS group (2.3%). The median stent patency period was significantly longer (p = .0112) in the covered MS group (455 days) than that of the uncovered MS group (301 days). A significant difference in the median survival period was not found between the 2 groups. Covered MS showed the possibility of extending the stent patency period by suppressing tumor ingrowth more than uncovered MS does.

The purpose of this trial was to compare the effectiveness of standardized outpatient cardiac rehabilitation combined with treadmill power walking versus standardized outpatient cardiac rehabilitation alone on health-related quality of life (HQoL), functional exercise capacity (FEC), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and metabolic equivalent of tasks (METs) in patients who went post coronary angioplasty (CA). Further this study evaluated the association between average numbers of steps taken with above clinical outcomes. In a pragmatic sequential randomized clinical trial, 24 patients were randomized into two groups (n = 12) and participated in a standardized outpatient cardiac rehabilitation program (SOCRP) with treadmill power walking as an intervention group and SOCRP alone in control group. Scores obtained before and after 4 weeks of intervention, that is, after 12 treatment sessions were assessed using a HQoL questionnaire and 6-min walk test (6 MWT). Average number of steps taken throughout the 4 weeks, METs and LVEF values were obtained by pedometer, exercise stress testing and echocardiogram respectively. Significant improvements were found in intergroup and intragroup comparison after 4 weeks of cardiac rehabilitation (p < 0.05). Scores of 6 MWT and LVEF significantly improved in the intervention group (p < 0.003) compared to the control group (p < 0.032). HQoL components that is, global and physical, MET values and average number of steps were significantly higher in the intervention group compared to the control group (p < 0.001). SOCRP with power walking was more effective in improving HQoL, FEC, LVEF, METs and average numbers of steps than SOCRP alone although both interventions were significant after 4 weeks in patients underwent CA and completed cardiac rehabilitation program. Positive significant associations were found between the average number of steps taken with scores of METs and scores of global and physical domains of HQoL.", "labels": [[57, 96, "Patient"], [495, 543, "Patient"], [598, 657, "Outcome"], [787, 897, "Intervention"], [938, 1261, "Outcome"], [0, 53, "Intervention"], [169, 182, "Outcome"], [186, 270, "Intervention"], [278, 330, "Control"], [334, 491, "Outcome"], [908, 919, "Control"], [1700, 1954, "TOREMOVE"]]}
{"id": "34087659", "text": "Perioperative supplemental oxygen and NT-proBNP concentrations after major abdominal surgery - A prospective randomized clinical trial. Supplemental oxygen is a simple method to improve arterial oxygen saturation and might therefore improve myocardial oxygenation. Thus, we tested whether intraoperative supplemental oxygen reduces the risk of impaired cardiac function diagnosed with NT-proBNP and myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery (MINS) diagnosed with high-sensitivity Troponin T. Parallel-arm double-blinded single-centre superiority randomized trial. Operating room and postoperative recovery area. 260 patients over the age of 45 years at-risk for cardiovascular complications undergoing major abdominal surgery. Administration of 80% versus 30% oxygen throughout surgery and for the first two postoperative hours. The primary outcome was the postoperative maximum NT-proBNP concentration in both groups, which was assessed within 2 h after surgery, and on the first and third postoperative day. The secondary outcome was the incidence of MINS in both groups. 128 patients received 80% oxygen and 130 received 30% oxygen throughout surgery and for the first two postoperative hours. There was no significant difference in the median postoperative maximum NT-proBNP concentration between the 80% and the 30% oxygen group (989 pg.mL -1  [IQR 499; 2005] and 810 pg.mL -1  [IQR 409; 2386], effect estimate: 159 pg.mL -1 , 95%CI -123, 431, p = 0.704). There was no difference in the incidence of MINS between both groups. (p = 0.703). There was no beneficial effect of perioperative supplemental oxygen administration on postoperative NT-proBNP concentration and MINS. It seems likely that supplemental oxygen has no effect on the release of NT-proBNP in patients at-risk for cardiovascular complications undergoing major abdominal surgery.

{"id": "34309987", "text": "Melissa officinalis tea favourably affects the frequency of premature ventricular beats and cardiometabolic profile among patients with premature ventricular contraction: A randomised open-label controlled trial. Premature ventricular contraction (PVC) as one of the most common arrhythmias could worsen the morbidity of cardiovascular events, particularly concurrent with other risk factors. Considering the probable side effects of antiarrhythmic drugs chronic use, prescribing herbal medicines for such conditions is on the rise. Melissa officinalis (MO) is widely identified as an antiarrhythmic and cardioprotective agent but there is limited evidence for its clinical use. This research, thus, aimed to investigate the effects of MO tea among patients with PVCs. The present 12-week randomised controlled trial enrolled 60 patients with confirmed diagnosis of moderate to low-grade PVCs. The patients in intervention group received MO teabags (containing 2-g dried leaves/250 mL in hot water) two times/day in addition to lifestyle modification recommendations, while control group only received lifestyle modification recommendations. After collecting the data, blood samples were gathered to explore serum concentrations of glucose and lipid markers. The number of premature ventricular beats and heart rates was determined by 24-hour rhythm Holter monitoring. On average, the patients aged 47 years and approximately 67.8% (n = 40) were women. The ANCOVA adjusted for baseline values and confounders revealed that patients in the MO tea group had significantly lower concentrations of triglyceride (adjusted mean (AM) = 144.75 mg/dL), total cholesterol (AM = 155.35 mg/dL), and fasting blood sugar (AM = 90.85 mg/dL), compared with the controls (AM = 174.27, 171.99, 99.84 mg/dL, respectively (P-value ≤.042). However, the intervention failed to affect LDL-C and HDL-C levels significantly. Significantly reduced frequency of 24-hour premature ventricular beats in the MO tea group (AM = 2142.39) was also noted compared with the controls (AM = 3126.05); (P-value = .017). The 24-hour heartbeats showed only a significant decrease within the intervention group (P-value < .01). Together, these results seem to support the higher cardioprotective effects of MO as a medicinal plant than lifestyle modifications alone.
