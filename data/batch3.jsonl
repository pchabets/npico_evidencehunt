In this single phase 1, randomized (3:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 96 participants received single and multiple ascending oral doses of enpatoran. Participants in single-dose cohorts received one dose of enpatoran (1, 3, 9, 25, 50, 100, or 200 mg) or placebo using a sentinel dosing strategy. Multiple-dose cohorts received enpatoran (9, 25, or 200 mg once daily, or 25 or 50 mg twice daily) or placebo for 14 days. Safety, tolerability, PK, and PD (ex vivo-stimulated cytokine secretion) were assessed in both parts. The effect of food was assessed in an open-label, one-way crossover study in the 25 mg single-dose cohort. Single- and multiple-oral doses of enpatoran up to 200 mg were well tolerated and no significant dose-limiting adverse events or safety signals were observed under fasting or fed conditions. PK parameters were linear and dose-proportional across the dose range evaluated, with a slightly delayed absorption and lower peak concentration observed at 25 mg with food. Exposure-dependent inhibition of ex vivo-stimulated interleukin-6 secretion was observed, with maximum inhibition at 200 mg. Enpatoran was well tolerated at doses up to 200 mg.

To prevent medical sequelae of severe hypoglycemic emergencies, prompt and reliable rescue intervention is critically important. A ready-to-use, liquid stable glucagon, administered subcutaneously by glucagon autoinjector (GAI), Gvoke HypoPen (glucagon injection; Xeris Pharmaceuticals), was evaluated for rescue treatment of severe hypoglycemia. Two phase III, randomized, controlled, blinded, non-inferiority crossover studies were conducted in 161 adults with type 1 diabetes to compare 1 mg doses of GAI versus glucagon emergency kit (GEK) for treating insulin-induced severe hypoglycemia. Efficacy was evaluated as either a return of plasma glucose to >70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) or increase ≥20 mg/dL (1.1 mmol/L) from a baseline glucose of <50 mg/dL (2.9 mmol/L), within 30 min of dosing. For successful plasma glucose recovery within 30 min, treatment with GAI was non-inferior to GEK. Treatment with GAI was non-inferior to GEK for a plasma glucose >70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) or neuroglycopenic symptom relief within 30 min. From administration of glucagon, the mean time to achieve plasma glucose >70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) or increase ≥20 mg/dL (1.1 mmol/L) was 13.8±5.6 min for GAI and 10.0±3.6 min for GEK.

Meal composition is known to affect glycemic variability and glucose control in type 1 diabetes. The objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of high carbohydrate meals of different nutritional composition and alcohol on the postprandial glucose response in patients with type 1 diabetes. Twelve participants were recruited to this randomized crossover trial. Following a 4-week run-in period, participants received a mixed meal on three occasions with the same carbohydrate content but different macronutrient composition: high protein-high fat with alcohol (0.7g/kg body weight, beer), high protein-high fat without alcohol, and low protein-low fat without alcohol at 2-week intervals. Plasma and interstitial glucose, insulin, glucagon, growth hormone, cortisol, alcohol, free fatty acids, lactate, and pH concentrations were measured during 6 hours. A statistical analysis was then carried out to determine significant differences between studies. Significantly higher late postprandial glucose was observed in studies with higher content of fats and proteins (p=0.0088). This was associated with lower time in hypoglycemia as compared with the low protein and fat study (p=0.0179), at least partially due to greater glucagon concentration in the same period (p=0.04). Alcohol significantly increased lactate, decreased pH and growth hormone, and maintained free fatty acids suppressed during the late postprandial phase (p<0.001), without significant changes in plasma glucose. Our data suggest that the addition of proteins and fats to carbohydrates increases late postprandial blood glucose.

Ustekinumab (UST), a newly-used biologic targeting p40 subunit of IL12 and IL23 in China, exerts a confirmed therapeutic effect on the induction and maintenance therapies for refractory Crohn's disease (CD). Therapeutic drug monitoring based on trough and antibody concentration is of core importance when treating patients who lose response to UST. We aimed to analyze the UST exposure-response relationship in CD treatment in the real-world setting. We retrospectively enrolled patients with CD who received UST between March 1, 2020 and May 31, 2021, at the inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) center of the Sun Yat-Sun Affiliated Sixth Hospital. Baseline characteristic information, biomarker examination, clinical outcomes determined by the Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI), and endoscopic outcomes evaluated using a simple endoscopic score for Crohn's disease (SES-CD) at week 16/20 were collected. The optimal UST cut-off trough concentration was identified using receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis. Nineteen eligible patients were included in the study, the mean age was 29.1 ± 9.1 years and the mean disease duration was 5.5 ± 4.7 years. At the initiation of the study, 89.5% of the patients had been exposed to prior biologics, 42.1% had previous CD-related surgeries, and 52.6% had perianal diseases. At week 16/20 after the UST initiation, clinical response, clinical remission, endoscopic response, and endoscopic remission were 89.5%, 84.2%, 42.2%, and 73.7%, respectively. The cut-off optimal trough concentration for UST was 1.12 μg/mL, as determined by the ROC with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.78, sensitivity of 87.5%, and specificity of 72.7%.

Prescribers were randomized 1:1 to either a 12-month intervention consisting of a nurse care manager with an interactive electronic registry, opioid education, academic detailing, and access to addiction specialists or a control condition consisting of usual care. Two primary outcomes were assessed through electronic medical records: ≥2 urine drug tests and any early COT refills by 12 months. Other outcomes included possible adverse consequences.

None of the patients showed any signs of laxity or failure at one-year follow-up. Pain scores were slightly better (not statistically significant) in the group-1. However, no differences were noted in functional outcomes scores. Pie-crusting of superficial MCL is a safe, controlled and less invasive approach for medial soft tissue release. When knee deformity is not correctable with initial soft tissue release, this is an appropriate next surgical step. There does not appear to be a risk of over-release during the surgery or afterward.

Although important, heart failure self-care remains a challenge for many patients. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of a nurse-led, home-based self-management psychosocial education intervention (HOM-HEMP). The primary outcome was patient's HF self-care in terms of maintenance, management and confidence. The secondary outcomes were cardiac self-efficacy, psychological wellbeing in terms of perceived social support, health related quality of life and levels of anxiety and depression. The clinical outcomes included New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class and numbers of unplanned health service visits due to cardiac-related reasons. A three-arm stratified randomized controlled trial was conducted (Clinical trial registration number: NCT03108235). A total of 213 participants admitted for heart failure were recruited from the inpatient wards of a tertiary public hospital in Singapore. They were randomly allocated to the control group, the experimental group A or the experimental group B. All participants received the usual care provided by the hospital. Participants in experimental groups A and B received the HOM-HEMP intervention, and those in experimental group B received an additional supplemental smartphone application. Data were collected at baseline, 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months from baseline. Compared to the control groups, participants in either of the experimental group had significantly higher levels of heart failure self-care maintenance (F = 4.222, p = 0.001), self-care confidence (F = 5.796, p < 0.001) and self-care management (p < 0.05) at 6-week, 3-month and 6-month follow-ups. In addition, both experimental groups had significantly higher levels of cardiac self-efficacy, better health related quality of life and lower depression levels than the control group after the study intervention. A higher proportion of participants in both experimental groups had a better New York Heart Association functional class at 6-week and 3-month follow-ups. Participants in the experimental group B also had significantly fewer cardiac-related unplanned hospital admissions and emergency room visits than the control group at 6-month follow-up.

The heart has an intrinsic ability to regenerate, orchestrated by progenitor or stem cells.

Thiamine analogues improve resident CPC function in pre-clinical models. In this double blinded randomised controlled trial (identifier: ACTRN12614000755639), we examined whether thiamine would improve CPC function in humans. High dose oral thiamine (one gram twice daily) or matching placebo was administered 3-5 days prior to coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG). Right atrial appendages were collected at the time of CABG, and CPCs isolated. There was no difference in the primary outcome (proliferation ability of CPCs) between treatment groups. Older age was not associated with decreased proliferation ability. In exploratory analyses, isolated CPCs in the thiamine group showed an increase in the proportion of CD34 - /CD105 +  (endoglin) cells, but no difference in CD34 - /CD90 +  or CD34 +  cells. Thiamine increased maximum force developed by isolated trabeculae, with no difference in relaxation time or beta-adrenergic responsiveness.

The low quality of life in heart failure patients is related to low self-care and treatment adherence. Consequently, innovative strategies are needed to improve them. The objective of this work is to determine the effectiveness of the use of a home telemonitoring system to improve the self-care and treatment adherence of heart failure patients. A randomized clinical trial that compares the efficacy of a home telemonitoring system -intervention group versus usual care control group - among heart failure outpatients over a 90-day monitoring period was carried out. The home telemonitoring system consists of an application that collects measurements of different parameters on a daily basis and provides health education to patients. The home telemonitoring system processes data gathered and generates an alert if a risky situation arises. The outcomes observed were significant changes in patients' self-care (European Heart Failure Self-care Behaviour Scale), treatment adherence (Morisky Modified Scale) and re-hospitalizations over the follow-up period. 104 heart failure patients were screened; 40 met the inclusion criteria; only 30 completed the study. After the follow-up, intragroup analysis of the control group indicated a decrease in treatment adherence (p = 0.02). The mean European Heart Failure Self-care Behaviour Scale overall score indicated an improved self-care in the intervention group patients (p = 0.03) and a worsened self-care in the control group (p = 0.04) with a p value of 0.004 in the intergroup analysis. Thanks to the home telemonitoring system alerts, two re-hospitalizations were avoided.

The role of cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is well established in the secondary prevention of ischemic heart disease. Unfortunately, the participation rates across Europe remain low, especially in elderly. The EU-CaRE RCT investigated the effectiveness of a home-based mobile CR programme in elderly patients that were not willing to participate in centre-based CR. The initial study concluded that a 6-month home-based mobile CR programme was safe and beneficial in improving VO2peak when compared with no CR. To assess whether a 6-month guided mobile CR programme is a cost-effective therapy for elderly patients who decline participation in CR. Patients were enrolled in a multicentre randomised clinical trial from November 11, 2015, to January 3, 2018, and follow-up was completed on January 17, 2019, in a secondary care system with 6 cardiac institutions across 5 European countries. A total of 179 patients who declined participation in centre-based CR and met the inclusion criteria consented to participate in the European Study on Effectiveness and Sustainability of Current Cardiac Rehabilitation Programs in the Elderly trial. The data of patients (n = 17) that were lost in follow-up were excluded from this analysis. The intervention (n = 79) consisted of 6 months of mobile CR programme with telemonitoring, and coaching based on motivational interviewing to stimulate patients to reach exercise goals. Control patients did not receive any form of CR throughout the study period. The costs considered for the cost-effectiveness analysis of the RCT are direct costs 1) of the mobile CR programme, and 2) of the care utilisation recorded during the observation time from randomisation to the end of the study. Costs and outcomes (utilities) were compared by calculation of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. The healthcare utilisation costs (P = 0.802) were not significantly different between the two groups. However, the total costs were significantly higher in the intervention group (P = 0.040). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for the primary endpoint VO2peak at 6 months was €1085 per 1-unit [ml/kg/min] improvement in change VO2peak and at 12 months it was €1103 per 1 unit [ml/kg/min] improvement in change VO2peak. Big differences in the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for the primary endpoint VO2peak at 6 months and 12 months were present between the adherent participants and the non-adherent participants. From a health-economic point of view the home-based mobile CR programme is an effective and cost-effective alternative for elderly cardiac patients who are not willing to participate in a regular rehabilitation programme to improve cardiorespiratory fitness. The change of QoL between the mobile CR was similar for both groups. Adherence to the mobile CR programme plays a significant role in the cost-effectiveness of the intervention.

Limits to ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) criteria may lead to prolonged diagnostic time for acute coronary occlusion. We aimed to reduce ECG-to-Activation (ETA) time through audit and feedback on STEMI-equivalents and subtle occlusions, without increasing Code STEMIs without culprit lesions. This multi-centre, quality improvement initiative reviewed all Code STEMI patients from the emergency department (ED) over a one-year baseline and one-year intervention period. We measured ETA time, from the first ED ECG to the time a Code STEMI was activated. Our intervention strategy involved a grand rounds presentation and an internal website presenting weekly local challenging cases, along with literature on STEMI-equivalents and subtle occlusions. Our outcome measure was ETA time for culprit lesions, our process measure was website views/visits, and our balancing measure was the percentage of Code STEMIs without culprit lesions. There were 51 culprit lesions in the baseline period, and 64 in the intervention period. Median ETA declined from 28.0 min (95% confidence interval [CI] 15.0-45.0) to 8.0 min (95%CI 6.0-15.0).

{"id": "32855096", "data": "Coexistence of transmural and lateral wavefront progression of myocardial infarction in the human heart. According to the wavefront phenomenon described in the late 1970s, myocardial infarction triggered by acute coronary occlusion progresses with increasing duration of ischemia as a transmural wavefront from the subendocardium toward the subepicardium. However, whether wavefront progression of necrosis also occurs laterally has been disputed. We aimed to assess the transmural and lateral spread of myocardial damage after acute myocardial infarction in humans and to evaluate the impact of metoprolol on these. We assessed myocardial infarction in the transmural and lateral dimensions in a cohort of 220 acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients from the METOCARD-CNIC trial (Effect of Metoprolol in Cardioprotection During an Acute Myocardial Infarction). The patients underwent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging at 5 to 7 days and 6 months post-STEMI. On day 5 to 7 post-STEMI cardiac magnetic resonance, there was a strong linear correlation between the transmural and lateral extent of infarction (delayed gadolinium enhancement) (r=-0.88; P<.001). Six months after STEMI, myocardial scarring (delayed gadolinium enhancement) was significantly less extensive in the transmural and lateral dimensions, suggesting that infarct resorption occurs in both. Furthermore, progression in both directions occurred both in patients receiving metoprolol and control patients, implying that myocardial salvage occurs both in the transmural and the lateral direction. Our findings challenge the assumption that irreversible injury does not spread laterally. A circumferential or multidirectional wavefront would imply that cardioprotective therapies might produce meaningful salvage at lateral borders of the infarct.

Mechanical thrombectomy using a stent retriever or contact aspiration is widely used for treatment of patients with acute ischemic stroke due to anterior circulation large vessel occlusion, but the additional benefit of combining contact aspiration with stent retriever is uncertain. To determine whether mechanical thrombectomy for treatment of anterior circulation large vessel occlusion stroke with initial contact aspiration and stent retriever combined results in better final angiographic outcome than with standard stent retriever alone. This trial was a multicenter randomized, open-label, blinded end point evaluation that enrolled 408 patients from October 16, 2017, to May 29, 2018, in 11 French comprehensive stroke centers, with a 12-month outcome follow-up. Patients with a large vessel occlusion in the anterior circulation were included up to 8 hours after symptom onset. The final date of follow-up was June, 19, 2019. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1 allocation) to receive initial thrombectomy with contact aspiration and stent retriever combined (205) or stent retriever alone (203). The primary outcome was the rate of expanded Thrombolysis In Cerebral Infarction score of 2c or 3 (eTICI 2c/3; ie, scores indicate near-total and total reperfusion grades) at the end of the procedure. Among the 408 patients who were randomized, 3 were excluded, and 405 (99.3%) patients (mean age, 73 years; 220 [54%] women and 185 [46%] men) were included in the primary analysis.

In the intervention group, we increased patients' blood pressure to 150 mmHg for 5 min using a norepinephrine pump (0.05 μg/kg/min initial dose) after the specimen was extracted during the ESD operation to identify and coagulate potential bleeding spots with hot biopsy forceps. Our primary outcome was the incidence of postoperative bleeding over 60-day follow-up. The incidence of post-ESD bleeding was lower in the intervention group (1.3%, 2/151) than in the control group (10.1%, 16/158, p = 0.01). Deeper tumor invasion was associated with a higher risk of post-ESD bleeding (5.3% in mucosal/submucosal layer 1 group vs. 12.5% in submucosal layer 2/muscularis propria group, p < 0.001). Multi-factor but not univariate analysis showed that proton pump inhibitor administration three times per day may be a better choice than twice per day. Increasing blood pressure under hemostasis during ESD to identify and coagulate potential bleeding spots could reduce the risk of delayed bleeding after gastric ESD.", "label": [[502, 527, "X"], [864, 1114, "I"], [1144, 1201, "X"], [1683, 1847, "B"], [0, 40, "I"], [50, 104, "X"], [391, 489, "I"], [596, 677, "P"], [825, 835, "C"]]}

During the COVID-19 pandemic, telehealth became a vital resource to contain the virus's spread and ensure continuity of care of patients with a chronic condition, notably arterial hypertension and heart disease. This paper reports the experience based on a telehealth platform used at scale to manage chronic disease patients in the Italian community. Patients' health status was remotely monitored through ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), resting or ambulatory electrocardiogram (ECG), spirometry, sleep oximetry, and cardiorespiratory polysomnography performed in community pharmacies or general practitioners' offices. Patients also monitored their blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), blood oxygen saturation (SpO2), body temperature, body weight, waist circumference, blood glucose, and lipids at home through a dedicated smartphone app. All data conveyed to the web-based telehealth platform were used to manage critical patients by doctors promptly. Data were analyzed and compared across three consecutive periods of 2 months each: i) before the national lockdown, ii) during the lockdown (from March 9 to May 17, 2020), and iii) after the end of the containment measures. Overall, 13,613 patients visited community pharmacies or doctors' offices. The number of overall tests dropped during and rose after the lockdown. The overall proportion of abnormal tests was larger during the outbreak. A significant increase in the prevalence of abnormal ECGs due to myocardial ischemia, contrasted by a significantly improved BP control, was observed. The number of home users and readings exchanged increased during the pandemic. In 226 patients, a significant increase in the proportion of SpO2 readings and a significant reduction in the entries for all other parameters, except BP, was observed. The proportion of abnormal SpO2 and BP values was significantly lower during the lockdown. Following the lockdown, the proportion of abnormal body weight or waist circumference values increased.

Visual inspection and biopsy is the current standard of care for oral cancer diagnosis, but is subject to misinterpretation and consequently to misdiagnosis. Topically applied PARPi-FL is a molecularly specific, fluorescent contrast-based approach that may fulfill the unmet need for a simple, in vivo, non-invasive, cost-effective, point-of-care method for the early diagnosis of oral cancer. Here, we present results from a phase I safety and feasibility study on fluorescent, topically applied PARPi-FL. Twelve patients with a histologically proven oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) gargled a PARPi-FL solution for 60 s (15 mL, 100 nM, 250 nM, 500 nM, or 1000 nM), followed by gargling a clearing solution for 60 s. Fluorescence measurements of the lesion and surrounding oral mucosa were taken before PARPi-FL application, after PARPi-FL application, and after clearing. Blood pressure, oxygen levels, clinical chemistry, and CBC were obtained before and after tracer administration. PARPi-FL was well-tolerated by all patients without any safety concerns. When analyzing the fluorescence signal, all malignant lesions showed a significant differential in contrast after administration of PARPi-FL, with the highest increase occurring at the highest dose level (1000 nM), where all patients had a tumor-to-margin fluorescence signal ratio of >3. A clearing step was essential to increase signal specificity, as it clears unbound PARPi-FL trapped in normal anatomical structures. PARPi-FL tumor cell specificity was confirmed by ex vivo tabletop confocal microscopy. We have demonstrated that the fluorescence signal arose from the nuclei of tumor cells, endorsing our macroscopic findings.

To compare the clinical effectiveness of various types of high-level laser therapy (HLLT) toward scalpel excision for the surgical treatment of erosive oral lichen planus (OLP). The total number of 128 individuals were enrolled in the study. The 35 did not meet the inclusion criteria due to malignancy signs and presence of diabetes mellitus. In total, 8 were lost to follow-up, and 10 were excluded from the analysis, due to analgesics intake. This way 75 patients with the erosive form of OLP were analyzed in three intervention groups (Er:YAG, n = 19; Nd:YAG, n = 15; Er:YAG + Nd:YAG combination, n = 20) and one control group with scalpel excision (n = 21). The therapy effectiveness has been assessed based on the comparison of salivary interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 and interferon (IFN)-γ preoperative levels to 14, 30 days, and 2 years postoperation, as well as pain level and time of epithelization. All HLLT groups demonstrated a significantly (p > 0.05) higher IL-1β, IL-6, IFNγ and pain level reduction and quicker epithelization toward the control group on the 30th day, except Nd:YAG in case of IFNγ level. The highest IL-1β, IFNγ and pain level reduction and quicker epithelization on the 30th day was observed in Er:YAG group, followed by Er:YAG + Nd:YAG combination, Nd:YAG respectively. However no significant difference was observed between the HLLT groups with regard to IL-6 level reduction. After a 2-year follow-up, no significant difference was observed between all study groups with regard to all variables. HLLT yields a superior clinical outcome compared to the scalpel excision for the surgical treatment of oral lichen planus, whereby the Er:YAG has been proposed as the most effective laser type at the end of the first postoperative month. For the surgical treatment of erosive OLP the Er:YAG laser may be a preferable treatment option compared to Nd:YAG and scalpel surgery.

Patients who repeatedly fail therapy represent a population in whom effective and well-tolerated treatment options are limited. To investigate and describe patients achieving Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 100 and cumulative treatment benefit over time in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis receiving brodalumab or ustekinumab by prior treatment.

FGFR2 fusions or rearrangements occur in 10-16% of patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. Infigratinib is a selective, ATP-competitive inhibitor of fibroblast growth factor receptors. We aimed to evaluate the antitumour activity of infigratinib in patients with locally advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma, FGFR2 alterations, and previous gemcitabine-based treatment. This multicentre, open-label, single-arm, phase 2 study recruited patients from 18 academic centres and hospitals in the USA, Belgium, Spain, Germany, Singapore, Taiwan, and Thailand. Eligible participants were aged 18 years or older, had histologically or cytologically confirmed, locally advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma and FGFR2 fusions or rearrangements, and were previously treated with at least one gemcitabine-containing regimen. Patients received 125 mg of oral infigratinib once daily for 21 days of 28-day cycles until disease progression, intolerance, withdrawal of consent, or death. Radiological tumour evaluation was done at baseline and every 8 weeks until disease progression via CT or MRI of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and coronary heart disease (CHD) are two chronic diseases that cause a tremendous burden. To reduce this burden, several programmes for optimising the care for these diseases have been developed. In Germany, so-called disease management programmes (DMPs), which combine components of Disease Management and the Chronic Care Model, are applied. These DMPs have proven effective. Nevertheless, there are opportunities for improvement. Current DMPs rarely address self-management of the disease, make no use of peer support, and provide no special assistance for persons with low health literacy and/or low patient activation. The study protocol presented here is for the evaluation of a programme that addresses these possible shortcomings and can be combined with current German DMPs for T2DM and CHD.

Between May 2018 and September 2019, 45 female patients with osteoporosis were included in the randomized clinical study, their age ranged from 40 to 50 years, had thyroidectomy for at least 6 months ago, and had an inactive lifestyle for at least the previous 6 months. Patients were assigned randomly into 3 equal groups. Group A (magnetic therapy group): received routine medical treatment (bisphosphonates, calcium, and vitamin D) in addition to pulsed magnetic therapy on the hip region for 12 weeks (3 sessions/week). Group B (exercise group): received routine medical treatment plus moderate-intensity aerobic exercise for 12 weeks (3 sessions/week). Group C (combined magnetic therapy and exercise therapy group): received routine medical treatment plus pulsed magnetic therapy and moderate-intensity aerobic exercise for 12 weeks (3 sessions/week). The 3 groups were assessed for bone mineral density (BMD) at baseline by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry and after 12 weeks of treatment. The results showed that within-group analysis a statistically significant increase was reveled (P < .05) for BMD in the 3 studied groups. Comparing the results among the 3 tested groups revealed a significant increase (P < .05) in posttesting mean values of BMD in group (C) compared to group (A) and group (B). No significant statistical difference in BMD means values between the 2 groups (A) and (B) after testing was detected. Combination of both pulsed magnetic therapy and moderate-intensity aerobic exercise showed significant improvement in BMD at the hip region than using any of the 2 modalities alone.", "label": [[64, 85, "P"], [428, 474, "P"], [598, 745, "P"], [1365, 1471, "X"], [1904, 2084, "B"], [14, 60, "I"], [345, 424, "I"], [516, 549, "P"], [800, 1332, "I"]]}

The present study investigated the value of ultrasomics signatures in the preoperative prediction of the pathological grading of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) via machine learning. A total of 193 patients were collected from three hospitals. The patients from two hospitals (n = 160) were randomly divided into training set (n = 128) and test set (n = 32) at a 8:2 ratio. The patients from a third hospital were used as an independent validation set (n = 33). The ultrasomics features were extracted from the tumor lesions on the ultrasound images. Support vector machine (SVM) was used to construct three preoperative pathological grading models for HCC on each dataset. The performance of the three models was evaluated by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. The ultrasomics signatures extracted from the grayscale ultrasound images could successfully differentiate between high- and low-grade HCC lesions on the training set, test set, and the independent validation set (p < 0.05). On the test set and the validation set, the combined model's performance was the highest, followed by the ultrasomics model and the clinical model successively (p < 0.05). Their AUC (along with 95 %CI) of these models was 0.874(0.709-0.964), 0.789(0.608-0.912), 0.720(0.534-0.863) and 0.849(0.682-0.949), 0.825(0.654-0.935), 0.770(0.591-0.898), respectively.

The authors' primary hypothesis was that pain relief would be better with a nerve block. Secondarily, they hypothesized that analgesic use, survival, and quality of life might be affected. This randomized, double-blind, parallel-armed trial was conducted in five Chinese centers. Eligible patients suffering from moderate to severe pain conditions were randomly assigned to receive splanchnic nerve block with either absolute alcohol (neurolysis) or normal saline (control). The primary outcome was pain relief measured on a visual analogue scale. Opioid consumption, survival, quality of life, and adverse effects were also documented. Analgesics were managed using a protocol common to all centers. Patients were followed up for 8 months or until death. Ninety-six patients (48 for each group) were included in the analysis. Pain relief with neurolysis was greater for the first 3 months (largest at the first month; mean difference, 0.7 [95% CI, 0.3 to 1.0]; adjusted P < 0.001) compared with placebo injection.

These procedures were evaluated in four randomized controlled trials. Early results from these trials demonstrated similar rates of complications but higher rates of colonic restoration after PRA than HP. Long-term follow-up has not been reported to date. The aim of this study was to analyze long-term outcomes and quality of life (QoL) in patients previously enrolled in a prospective randomized trial comparing HP and PRA for generalized peritonitis due to perforated diverticulitis (DIVERTI trial). Follow-up data were available for 78 of 102 patients. Demographic data, incisional hernia rate, need for additional surgery related to the primary procedure, and QoL were recorded. The overall survival rate was 76% and did not differ between the two groups. Incisional hernia was reported in 21 (52%) patients in the HP arm and in 11 (29%) patients in the PRA arm (p = 0.035). The HP arm demonstrated significantly lower SF-36 physical and mental component scores. The mean general QoL (EQ-VAS) and mean EQ-5D index scores were better after PRA than after HP, but this difference was not statistically significant. The results of GIQLI, which measures intestine-specific QOL, did not differ between the two groups.

The transfusion rate in hysterectomies for benign pathology is almost 3%. However, despite the strong interest in reducing intraoperative bleeding, limited evidence is available regarding the technical aspects concerning uterine vessel management during a total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH). Uterine artery (UA) closure in TLH can be performed at the origin from the internal iliac artery or at the uterus level (UL). However, low-quality evidence is available regarding the superiority of one method over the other. We performed a single-blind randomized (1:1) controlled trial (NCT04156932) between December 2019 and August 2020. One hundred and eighty women undergoing TLH for benign gynecological diseases were randomized to TLH with UA closure at the origin from the internal iliac artery (n = 90), performed at the beginning of the procedure by putting two clips per side at the origin, vs closure at the UL (n = 90). Intraoperative blood loss estimated from suction devices was the primary outcome. Secondary end points were perioperative outcomes, the conversion rate from one technique to the other, and complication rates with 4 months of follow up. Uterine artery closure at the origin was completed in all 90 patients (0%), whereas closure at the UL was converted to closure at the origin in 11 cases (12.2%; p < 0.001); failures were mainly associated with the presence of endometriosis (81.8% [9/11] vs 10.1% [8/79]; p < 0.001). In the intention-to-treat analysis, the intraoperative blood loss was higher in the group assigned to the closure at the UL (108.5 mL) than in the group with closure at the origin (69.3 mL); the mean difference was 39.2 mL (95% CI 13.47-64.93 mL; p = 0.003). Other perioperative outcomes and complications rates did not differ. Uterine artery closure at the origin reduces intraoperative blood loss during a TLH and appears to be more reproducible than closure at the UL without higher complication rates.

High-dose dexamethasone is the standard initial treatment for patients with immune thrombocytopenia, but many patients still relapse and require further treatments. All-trans retinoic acid has been shown to exert immunomodulatory effects and promote thrombopoiesis, and so we aimed to assess the activity and safety of all-trans retinoic acid plus high-dose dexamethasone as a first-line treatment for newly diagnosed patients with immune thrombocytopenia. This multicentre, open-label, randomised, controlled, phase 2 trial was done at six different tertiary medical centres in China. Eligible participants were adults (aged >18 years) with treatment-naive, newly diagnosed, primary immune thrombocytopenia who had either a platelet count of less than 30 × 10 9  platelets per L or a platelet count of less than 50 × 10 9  platelets per L and clinically significant bleeding. We randomly assigned (1:1) participants to receive either all-trans retinoic acid (10 mg orally twice daily for 12 weeks) plus high-dose dexamethasone (40 mg/day intravenously for 4 consecutive days) or high-dose dexamethasone alone using a central, web-based randomisation system. If patients did not respond by day 14, the 4-day course of dexamethasone was repeated. The primary endpoint was 6-month sustained response, defined as the maintenance of a platelet count of at least 30 × 10 9  platelets per L and at least 2-times higher than the baseline count and the absence of bleeding, with no need for rescue medication at this time. The primary endpoint was analysed by intention-to-treat and safety was assessed in all participants who received at least one dose of the study drug. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04217148, and is now completed.

The 6-Minute Walking Test (6MWT) is a safe, standardized and well utilized method to assess the functional capacity. Recently, it was reported that the published prediction equations cannot accurately predict a valid maximal oxygen consumption (V̇O2 peak) value in cancer survivors. Thus, the aim of this study was to establish and to validate a new equation based on the 6MWT to predict V̇O2 peak in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) survivors. A total of 200 childhood ALL survivors were enrolled in this study, among which 168 participants underwent a cardiopulmonary exercise test and a 6MWT to assess their functional capacity and their cardiorespiratory fitness. In addition, participants completed a physical activity questionnaire. Participants were randomly divided in two groups to establish the equations (n = 118 (70%)) and to validate it (n = 50 (30%)). Multiple linear regression analyses were used to determine a new prediction equation for V̇O2 peak from 6MWT using clinical and specific variables related to the disease. The accuracy in between V̇O2 peak measured and V̇O2 peak predicted were assessed using the Bland and Altman method. The new establish clinical V̇O2 peak equation is: V̇O2 peak (mL.kg -1 .min -1 ) = (-0.283*age(years)) - (0.099*weight(kg)) + (0.071*6MWD(meters)) -(0.135*HR end(bpm)) + 22.789 with a mean bias of 2.67 mL.kg -1 .min -1  (95% CI (-9.64 to 14.98)). The new establish disease-specific V̇O2 peak equation is: V̇O2 peak (mL.kg -1 .min -1 ) = (-0.236*age(years)) - (0.094*weight(kg)) -(0.120*HR end(bpm)) + (0.067*6MWD(meters)) + (0.065*MVLPA(min/day)) - (0.204*DT(years)) + 25.145 with a mean bias of 2.51 mL.kg -1 .min -1  (95% CI (-9.98 to 15.01)). This is the first study that predicted V̇O2 peak from a 6MWT using clinical and specific variables related to the disease of childhood ALL survivors. The availability of these newly established V̇O2 peak equations makes them an accurate tool to provide a better follow-up and better adapted physical training for survivors. We invite researchers to use our assessment procedures for their further studies.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONIt is critical to understand the cardiorespiratory fitness of the childhood ALL survivorsThe maximal oxygen consumption (i.e., V̇O2 peak) is recognized as the gold standard to measure the patient's cardiorespiratory fitness in the field of exercise physiologyThis study is novel and reports the validation of two new VO2 peak equations, from 6MWT, by using clinical and disease-specific variables of childhood ALL survivorsThe availability of such validated equations can better facilitate the follow-up of survivors' cardiorespiratory fitness, by relevant health care professionals and exercise physiologists.", "label": [[86, 109, "P"], [512, 566, "P"], [677, 789, "X"], [827, 860, "X"], [1821, 1969, "B"], [0, 82, "X"], [429, 508, "X"], [583, 606, "P"], [989, 1159, "I"], [1160, 1275, "X"]]}

Patients with haematological cancer had considerable symptom burden, in which fatigue was the most prevalent. Almost 70% of haematological cancer patients reported fatigue. We conducted a parallel-group, non-blinded, randomised control trial at the haemato-oncology unit of University Malaya Medical Centre, from 1st October 2019 to 31st May 2020. Patients included were ≥ 18 years, had histopathological diagnosis of haematological cancer, and fatigue score of ≥4 based on the fatigue subscale of Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS). Patients allocated to the intervention group received standard care plus a guided 30-min mindful breathing session, while those in control group received standard care. The study outcomes include fatigue severity according to the fatigue subscale of ESAS, visual analogue scale of 0 - 10, and Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Fatigue Scale Version 4, at minute 0 and minute 30. Of 197 patients screened, 80 were eligible and they were equally randomised into 30-min mindful breathing versus standard care. Lymphoma (58.9%) was the commonest haematological malignancy, followed by multiple myeloma (13.8%), acute leukaemia (11.3%), myeloproliferative neoplasm (6.3%), chronic leukaemia (5.0%) and myelodysplastic syndrome (5.0%). There was no difference in the demographic and clinical characteristics between the 2 groups. At minute 0, both arms of patients had similar ESAS-fatigue score (median, 5) and FACIT-fatigue score (mean ± SD, 24.7 ± 10.6 for intervention group versus 24.7 ± 9.7 for control group). At minute 30, intervention group had lower ESAS-fatigue score (median, 3 versus 5) and FACIT-fatigue score (mean ± SD, 17.1 ± 10.5 versus 24.8 ± 11.3) compared to control group. Both the ESAS-fatigue score reduction (median, - 2 versus 0, p = 0.002) and FACIT-fatigue score reduction (mean ± SD, - 6.7 versus + 0.8; p < 0.001) for the intervention group were statistically significant. The calculated effect size Cohen's d was 1.4 for between-group comparison of differences in total FACIT-fatigue score. Our results provide evidence that a single session of 30-min mindful breathing was effective in reducing fatigue in haematological cancer patients.

CNS relapse of acute lymphocytic leukaemia is difficult to treat. Durable remissions of relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphocytic leukaemia have been observed following treatment with CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells; however, most trials have excluded patients with active CNS disease. We aimed to assess the safety and activity of CAR T-cell therapy in patients with a history of CNS relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphocytic leukaemia. In this post-hoc analysis, we included 195 patients (aged 1-29 years; 110 [56%] male and 85 [44%] female) with relapsed or refractory CD19-positive acute lymphocytic leukaemia or lymphocytic lymphoma from five clinical trials (Pedi CART19, 13BT022, ENSIGN, ELIANA, and 16CT022) done at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (Philadelphia, PA, USA), in which participants received CD19-directed CAR T-cell therapy between April 17, 2012, and April 16, 2019. The trials required control of CNS disease at enrolment and infusion and excluded treatment in the setting of acute neurological toxic effects (>grade 1 in severity) or parenchymal lesions deemed to increase the risk of neurotoxicity. 154 patients from Pedi CART19, ELIANA, ENSIGN, and 16CT022 received tisagenlecleucel and 41 patients from the 13BT022 trial received the humanised CD19-directed CAR, huCART19. We categorised patients into two strata on the basis of CNS status at relapse or within the 12 months preceding CAR T-cell infusion-either CNS-positive or CNS-negative disease. Patients with CNS-positive disease were further divided on the basis of morphological bone marrow involvement-either combined bone marrow and CNS involvement, or isolated CNS involvement. Endpoints were the proportion of patients with complete response at 28 days after infusion, Kaplan-Meier analysis of relapse-free survival and overall survival, and the incidence of cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity. Of all 195 patients, 66 (34%) were categorised as having CNS-positive disease and 129 (66%) as having CNS-negative disease, and 43 (22%) were categorised as having isolated CNS involvement. The median length of follow-up was 39 months (IQR 25-49) in the CNS-positive stratum and 36 months (18-49) in the CNS-negative stratum. The proportion of patients in the CNS-positive stratum with a complete response at 28 days after infusion was similar to that in the CNS-negative stratum (64 [97%] of 66 vs 121 [94%] of 129; p=0·74), with no significant difference in relapse-free survival (60% [95% CI 49-74] vs 60% [51-71]; p=0·50) or overall survival (83% [75-93] vs 71% [64-79]; p=0·39) at 2 years between the two groups. Overall survival at 2 years was significantly higher in patients with isolated CNS involvement compared with those with bone marrow involvement (91% [82-100] vs 71% [64-78]; p=0·046). The incidence and severity of neurotoxicity (any grade, 53 [41%] vs 38 [58%]; grade 1, 24 [19%] vs 20 [30%]; grade 2, 14 [11%] vs 10 [15%]; grade 3, 12 [9%] vs 6 [9%], and grade 4, 3 [2%] vs 2 [3%]; p=0·20) and cytokine release syndrome (any grade, 110 [85%] vs 53 [80%]; grade 1, 12 [9%] vs 2 [3%]; grade 2, 61 [47%] vs 38 [58%]; grade 3, 18 [14%] vs 7 [11%] and grade 4, 19 [15%] vs 6 [9%]; p=0·26) did not differ between the CNS-negative and the CNS-positive disease strata. Tisagenlecleucel and huCART19 are active at clearing CNS disease and maintaining durable remissions in children and young adults with CNS relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphocytic leukaemia or lymphocytic lymphoma, without increasing the risk of severe neurotoxicity; although care should be taken in the timing of therapy and disease control to mitigate this risk.

We investigated the feasibility and activity of an intensified dose-dense ABVD (dd-ABVD) regimen in patients with early-stage unfavorable Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). This prospective, multicenter, phase II study enrolled 96 patients with newly diagnosed, unfavorable stage I or II classical HL. The patients received four cycles of dd-ABVD followed by radiotherapy. Interim PET (PET-2) was mandatory after two courses. Primary endpoints were the evaluation of dd-ABVD feasibility and activity (incidence of PET-2 negativity). The feasibility endpoint was achieved with 48/52 (92.3%) patients receiving > 85% of the programmed dose. The mean dose intensity in the overall patient population (n = 96) was 93.7%, and the median duration of dd-ABVD was 85 days (range, 14-115) versus an expected duration of 84 days. PET-2 was available for 92/96 (95.8%) patients, of whom 79 were PET-2 negative (85.9%). In total, 90 (93.8%) patients showed complete response at the end of treatment.

Diethylcarbamazine citrate (DEC) treatment of loiasis is complicated by adverse reactions that are correlated with the number of circulating microfilariae (mf). The cause of these reactions is unknown, but they are accompanied by a dramatic interleukin-5 (IL-5)-dependent increase in eosinophilia and evidence of eosinophil activation. To explore the role of IL-5 driven eosinophilia in post-DEC reactions, 8 adults with confirmed loiasis and <5000 mf/mL blood were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of the humanized anti-IL-5 antibody, reslizumab, (1.0 mg/kg IV) administered 3 to 7 days prior to initiation of DEC treatment (9 mg/kg/day for 21 days). The primary endpoint was the reduction in absolute eosinophil count (AEC) during the first week of DEC treatment. Baseline characteristics were comparable between the two groups. Single dose reslizumab lowered the AEC by 77% prior to initiation of DEC therapy (vs. 12% in the placebo group, P < .05). More importantly, AEC remained below baseline in the first week of DEC treatment in all subjects who received reslizumab and in none of the placebo subjects. Mf clearance occurred within 2 days of initiation of DEC in all 7 mf-positive subjects. Mild to moderate adverse events were seen in all 8 subjects and were not significantly different between the groups.

Trilaciclib protects haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from chemotherapy-induced damage (myeloprotection). To assess the totality of the myeloprotective benefits of trilaciclib, including analysis of several clinically relevant but low-frequency events, an exploratory composite endpoint comprising five major adverse haematological events (MAHE) was prospectively defined: all-cause hospitalisations, all-cause chemotherapy dose reductions, febrile neutropenia (FN), prolonged severe neutropenia (SN) and red blood cell (RBC) transfusions on/after Week 5.

PCI was given to good responders. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). The analyses included 182 patients, with 94 in the twice-daily group and 88 in the once-daily group. CCTRT started with cycle 3 of chemotherapy for most patients (80.2%). At a median follow-up of 24.3 months, the median PFS was 13.4 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 10.8-16.0) in the twice-daily group versus 17.2 months (95% CI, 11.8-22.6) in the once-daily group (P = .031), with 2-year PFS rates of 28.4% (95% CI, 18.2-38.6) and 42.3% (95% CI, 31.1-53.5), respectively. The estimated overall survival was 33.6 months in the twice-daily group versus 39.3 months in the once-daily group (P = .137). The median locoregional PFS was 23.9 months in the twice-daily group and was not reached in the once-daily group (P = .017). The incidences of most toxicities were similar in both groups, except for a higher incidence of ≥grade 3 acute lymphopenia in the once-daily group (71.7% vs 40.2% in the twice-daily group; P < .001). There was no difference in the incidences of ≥grade 3 esophagitis (17.4% vs 15.3%, respectively), pneumonitis (3.3% vs 2.4%, respectively) or treatment-related death (2.2% vs 1.2%, respectively) between the once-daily and twice-daily groups.

Expectancies about symptom improvement or deterioration are reliable predictors of symptom progression and treatment outcomes (symptom resolution or symptomatic improvement) in many (non-)pharmacological studies and treatments. This study examined predictors of symptom improvement after antimicrobial therapy for persistent symptoms attributed to Lyme disease, hypothesizing particularly pre-treatment expectancies regarding symptom improvement to be predictive. A predictive study was performed on pre-treatment and post-treatment individual characteristics, including expectancies, and physical and mental health-related quality of life (HRQoL) from the PLEASE-trial comparing randomized 12-weeks of doxycycline, clarithromycin-hydroxychloroquine, or placebo following 2 weeks of intravenous ceftriaxone. At end-of-treatment (14 weeks after trial start) and follow-up (52 weeks), complete data of 231 and 170 (of initial 280) patients with persistent symptoms temporally related to a history of erythema migrans or otherwise confirmed symptomatic Lyme disease, or accompanied by B. burgdorferi IgG or IgM antibodies, were examined through hierarchical regression analyses. In addition to pre-treatment HRQoL, pre-treatment expectancies regarding symptom improvement were consistently associated with stronger physical and mental HRQoL improvements at both end-of-treatment and follow-up (95% CI range: .09;.54, p < .01 to .27;.92, p < .001).

Of the patients who received IL-6RAs, the majority received one dose of tocilizumab and sarilumab (dose range of 600-800 mg for tocilizumab and 200-400 mg for sarilumab). Regarding the timing of administration, we observed that steroid and IL-6RA administration on day 0 of ICU admission was only 55.6% and 39.5%, respectively. By day 28, when compared with steroid use alone, IL-6RA use was associated with an adjusted incidence rate ratio (aIRR) of 1.12 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.88, 1.4) for ventilator-free days, while combination therapy was associated with an aIRR of 0.83 (95% CI 0.6, 1.14). IL-6RA use was associated with an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of 0.68 (95% CI 0.44, 1.07) for the 28-day mortality rate, while combination therapy was associated with an aOR of 1.07 (95% CI 0.67, 1.70). Liver dysfunction was higher in IL-6RA group (p = 0.04), while the bacteremia rate did not differ among groups. Discordance was observed between the registry utilization patterns (i.e., timing of steroids and IL-6RA administration) and new evidence from the recent randomized controlled trials and guideline recommendations. These data will help us to identify areas of improvement in prescribing patterns and enhance our understanding of IL-6RA safety with different steroid regimens.

{"id": "34475136", "data": "Six-Month Efficacy and Toxicity Profile of BNT162b2 Vaccine in Cancer Patients with Solid Tumors. We had previously reported short-term efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety of the BNT162b2 vaccine among cancer patients with solid tumors. We aimed to evaluate these outcomes at six months postvaccination. The study cohort comprised patients who were on treatment during vaccination and throughout six months postvaccination. Serologic tests were performed after second vaccination and six months afterward. An age-matched cohort of health care workers served as controls. Documentation of COVID-19 infection, blood tests, and imaging studies during the study period was reviewed. Participants included 154 patients and 135 controls. Six months postvaccination, 122 (79%) patients were seropositive compared with 114 (84%) controls (P = 0.32). Serology titer dramatically decreased in a similar manner in both cohorts. No COVID-19 cases were documented in controls, and one case occurred in patient cohort. All previously reported adverse effects resolved. Taken together, the pattern of immunogenicity, efficacy, and safety of BNT162b2 in patients with cancer with solid tumors at six months postvaccination resembles that of the general population. SIGNIFICANCE: Evidence regarding efficacy and safety of COVID-19 vaccines in patients with cancer indicate a favorable short-term profile. Immunomodulation due to anticancer treatments may affect immunity and immunogenicity of patients with cancer to the BNT162b2 vaccine over time. Our study sheds light on these long-term outcomes and portrays a trend that resembles the general population.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 2355.", "label": [[63, 96, "P"], [203, 236, "P"], [277, 303, "X"], [425, 505, "X"], [532, 551, "C"], [43, 59, "I"], [0, 39, "X"], [137, 172, "X"], [180, 196, "I"], [332, 423, "P"], [589, 641, "X"], [1056, 1248, "B"]]}
{"id": "33887208", "data": "Safety and immunogenicity of an MF59-adjuvanted spike glycoprotein-clamp vaccine for SARS-CoV-2: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1 trial. Given the scale of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the development of vaccines based on different platforms is essential, particularly in light of emerging viral variants, the absence of information on vaccine-induced immune durability, and potential paediatric use. We aimed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of an MF59-adjuvanted subunit vaccine for COVID-19 based on recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein stabilised in a pre-fusion conformation by a novel molecular clamp (spike glycoprotein-clamp [sclamp]). We did a phase 1, double-blind, placebo-controlled, block-randomised trial of the sclamp subunit vaccine in a single clinical trial site in Brisbane, QLD, Australia. Healthy adults (aged ≥18 to ≤55 years) who had tested negative for SARS-CoV-2, reported no close contact with anyone with active or previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, and tested negative for pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 immunity were included. Participants were randomly assigned to one of five treatment groups and received two doses via intramuscular injection 28 days apart of either placebo, sclamp vaccine at 5 μg, 15 μg, or 45 μg, or one dose of sclamp vaccine at 45 μg followed by placebo. Participants and study personnel, except the dose administration personnel, were masked to treatment. The primary safety endpoints included solicited local and systemic adverse events in the 7 days after each dose and unsolicited adverse events up to 12 months after dosing. Here, data are reported up until day 57. Primary immunogenicity endpoints were antigen-specific IgG ELISA and SARS-CoV-2 microneutralisation assays assessed at 28 days after each dose. The study is ongoing and registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04495933. Between June 23, 2020, and Aug 17, 2020, of 314 healthy volunteers screened, 120 were randomly assigned (n=24 per group), and 114 (95%) completed the study up to day 57 (mean age 32·5 years [SD 10·4], 65 [54%] male, 55 [46%] female). Severe solicited reactions were infrequent and occurred at similar rates in participants receiving placebo (two [8%] of 24) and the SARS-CoV-2 sclamp vaccine at any dose (three [3%] of 96). Both solicited reactions and unsolicited adverse events occurred at a similar frequency in participants receiving placebo and the SARS-CoV-2 sclamp vaccine. Solicited reactions occurred in 19 (79%) of 24 participants receiving placebo and 86 (90%) of 96 receiving the SARS-CoV-2 sclamp vaccine at any dose. Unsolicited adverse events occurred in seven (29%) of 24 participants receiving placebo and 35 (36%) of 96 participants receiving the SARS-CoV-2 sclamp vaccine at any dose. Vaccination with SARS-CoV-2 sclamp elicited a similar antigen-specific response irrespective of dose: 4 weeks after the initial dose (day 29) with 5 μg dose (geometric mean titre [GMT] 6400, 95% CI 3683-11 122), with 15 μg dose (7492, 4959-11 319), and the two 45 μg dose cohorts (8770, 5526-13 920 in the two-dose 45 μg cohort; 8793, 5570-13 881 in the single-dose 45 μg cohort); 4 weeks after the second dose (day 57) with two 5 μg doses (102 400, 64 857-161 676), with two 15 μg doses (74 725, 51 300-108 847), with two 45 μg doses (79 586, 55 430-114 268), only a single 45 μg dose (4795, 2858-8043). At day 57, 67 (99%) of 68 participants who received two doses of sclamp vaccine at any concentration produced a neutralising immune response, compared with six (25%) of 24 who received a single 45 μg dose and none of 22 who received placebo. Participants receiving two doses of sclamp vaccine elicited similar neutralisation titres, irrespective of dose: two 5 μg doses (GMT 228, 95% CI 146-356), two 15 μg doses (230, 170-312), and two 45 μg doses (239, 187-307). This first-in-human trial shows that a subunit vaccine comprising mammalian cell culture-derived, MF59-adjuvanted, molecular clamp-stabilised recombinant spike protein elicits strong immune responses with a promising safety profile. However, the glycoprotein 41 peptide present in the clamp created HIV diagnostic assay interference, a possible barrier to widespread use highlighting the criticality of potential non-spike directed immunogenicity during vaccine development. Studies are ongoing with alternative molecular clamp trimerisation domains to ameliorate this response.

{"id": "34411004", "data": "In-hospital use of ACE inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers associates with COVID-19 outcomes in African American patients. BACKGROUNDThe angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) D allele is more prevalent among African Americans compared with other races and ethnicities and has previously been associated with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pathogenesis through excessive ACE1 activity. ACE inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (ACE-I/ARB) may counteract this mechanism, but their association with COVID-19 outcomes has not been specifically tested in the African American population.METHODSWe identified 6218 patients who were admitted into Mount Sinai hospitals with COVID-19 between February 24 and May 31, 2020, in New York City. We evaluated whether the outpatient and in-hospital use of ACE-I/ARB is associated with COVID-19 in-hospital mortality in an African American compared with non-African American population.RESULTSOf the 6218 patients with COVID-19, 1138 (18.3%) were ACE-I/ARB users. In a multivariate logistic regression model, ACE-I/ARB use was independently associated with a reduced risk of in-hospital mortality in the entire population (OR, 0.655; 95% CI, 0.505-0.850; P = 0.001), African American population (OR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.249-0.779; P = 0.005), and non-African American population (OR, 0.748, 95% CI, 0.553-1.012, P = 0.06). In the African American population, in-hospital use of ACE-I/ARB was associated with improved mortality (OR, 0.378; 95% CI, 0.188-0.766; P = 0.006), whereas outpatient use was not (OR, 0.889; 95% CI, 0.375-2.158; P = 0.812). When analyzing each medication class separately, ARB in-hospital use was significantly associated with reduced in-hospital mortality in the African American population (OR, 0.196; 95% CI, 0.074-0.516; P = 0.001), whereas ACE-I use was not associated with impact on mortality in any population.CONCLUSIONIn-hospital use of ARB was associated with a significant reduction in in-hospital mortality among COVID-19-positive African American patients.FUNDINGNone.", "label": [[101, 126, "P"], [1890, 2041, "B"], [19, 63, "I"], [80, 97, "X"], [627, 749, "P"], [776, 819, "I"], [839, 869, "X"], [876, 938, "P"]]}
{"id": "34597298", "data": "Different dose regimens of a SARS-CoV-2 recombinant spike protein vaccine (NVX-CoV2373) in younger and older adults: A phase 2 randomized placebo-controlled trial. NVX-CoV2373 is a recombinant severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (rSARS-CoV-2) nanoparticle vaccine composed of trimeric full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoproteins and Matrix-M1 adjuvant. The phase 2 component of our randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 1 to 2 trial was designed to identify which dosing regimen of NVX-CoV2373 should move forward into late-phase studies and was based on immunogenicity and safety data through Day 35 (14 days after the second dose). The trial was conducted at 9 sites in Australia and 8 sites in the United States. Participants in 2 age groups (aged 18 to 59 and 60 to 84 years) were randomly assigned to receive either 1 or 2 intramuscular doses of 5-μg or 25-μg NVX-CoV2373 or placebo, 21 days apart. Primary endpoints were immunoglobulin G (IgG) anti-spike protein response, 7-day solicited reactogenicity, and unsolicited adverse events. A key secondary endpoint was wild-type virus neutralizing antibody response. After enrollment, 1,288 participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 vaccine groups or placebo, with 1,283 participants administered at least 1 study treatment. Of these, 45% were older participants 60 to 84 years. Reactogenicity was predominantly mild to moderate in severity and of short duration (median <3 days) after first and second vaccination with NVX-CoV2373, with higher frequencies and intensity after second vaccination and with the higher dose. Reactogenicity occurred less frequently and was of lower intensity in older participants. Both 2-dose regimens of 5-μg and 25-μg NVX-CoV2373 induced robust immune responses in younger and older participants. For the 2-dose regimen of 5 μg, geometric mean titers (GMTs) for IgG anti-spike protein were 65,019 (95% confidence interval (CI) 55,485 to 76,192) and 28,137 (95% CI 21,617 to 36,623) EU/mL and for wild-type virus neutralizing antibody (with an inhibitory concentration of 50%-MN50%) were 2,201 (95% CI 1,343 to 3,608) and 981 (95% CI 560 to 1,717) titers for younger and older participants, respectively, with seroconversion rates of 100% in both age groups. Neutralizing antibody responses exceeded those seen in a panel of convalescent sera for both age groups. Study limitations include the relatively short duration of safety follow-up to date and current lack of immune persistence data beyond the primary vaccination regimen time point assessments, but these data will accumulate over time. The study confirmed the phase 1 findings that the 2-dose regimen of 5-μg NVX-CoV2373 is highly immunogenic and well tolerated in younger adults. In addition, in older adults, the 2-dose regimen of 5 μg was also well tolerated and showed sufficient immunogenicity to support its use in late-phase efficacy studies.

{"id": "34637450", "data": "Behavioural activation to prevent depression and loneliness among socially isolated older people with long-term conditions: The BASIL COVID-19 pilot randomised controlled trial. Older adults, including those with long-term conditions (LTCs), are vulnerable to social isolation. They are likely to have become more socially isolated during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, often due to advice to shield to protect them from infection. This places them at particular risk of depression and loneliness. There is a need for brief scalable psychosocial interventions to mitigate the psychological impacts of social isolation. Behavioural activation (BA) is a credible candidate intervention, but a trial is needed. We undertook an external pilot parallel randomised trial (ISRCTN94091479) designed to test recruitment, retention and engagement with, and the acceptability and preliminary effects of the intervention. Participants aged ≥65 years with 2 or more LTCs were recruited in primary care and randomised by computer and with concealed allocation between June and October 2020. BA was offered to intervention participants (n = 47), and control participants received usual primary care (n = 49). Assessment of outcome was made blind to treatment allocation. The primary outcome was depression severity (measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9)). We also measured health-related quality of life (measured by the Short Form (SF)-12v2 mental component scale (MCS) and physical component scale (PCS)), anxiety (measured by the Generalised Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7)), perceived social and emotional loneliness (measured by the De Jong Gierveld Scale: 11-item loneliness scale). Outcome was measured at 1 and 3 months. The mean age of participants was aged 74 years (standard deviation (SD) 5.5) and they were mostly White (n = 92, 95.8%), and approximately two-thirds of the sample were female (n = 59, 61.5%). Remote recruitment was possible, and 45/47 (95.7%) randomised to the intervention completed 1 or more sessions (median 6 sessions) out of 8. A total of 90 (93.8%) completed the 1-month follow-up, and 86 (89.6%) completed the 3-month follow-up, with similar rates for control (1 month: 45/49 and 3 months 44/49) and intervention (1 month: 45/47and 3 months: 42/47) follow-up. Between-group comparisons were made using a confidence interval (CI) approach, and by adjusting for the covariate of interest at baseline. At 1 month (the primary clinical outcome point), the median number of completed sessions for people receiving the BA intervention was 3, and almost all participants were still receiving the BA intervention. The between-group comparison for the primary clinical outcome at 1 month was an adjusted between-group mean difference of -0.50 PHQ-9 points (95% CI -2.01 to 1.01), but only a small number of participants had completed the intervention at this point. At 3 months, the PHQ-9 adjusted mean difference (AMD) was 0.19 (95% CI -1.36 to 1.75). When we examined loneliness, the adjusted between-group difference in the De Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale at 1 month was 0.28 (95% CI -0.51 to 1.06) and at 3 months -0.87 (95% CI -1.56 to -0.18), suggesting evidence of benefit of the intervention at this time point. For anxiety, the GAD adjusted between-group difference at 1 month was 0.20 (-1.33, 1.73) and at 3 months 0.31 (-1.08, 1.70). For the SF-12 (physical component score), the adjusted between-group difference at 1 month was 0.34 (-4.17, 4.85) and at 3 months 0.11 (-4.46, 4.67). For the SF-12 (mental component score), the adjusted between-group difference at 1 month was 1.91 (-2.64, 5.15) and at 3 months 1.26 (-2.64, 5.15). Participants who withdrew had minimal depressive symptoms at entry. There were no adverse events. The Behavioural Activation in Social Isolation (BASIL) study had 2 main limitations. First, we found that the intervention was still being delivered at the prespecified primary outcome point, and this fed into the design of the main trial where a primary outcome of 3 months is now collected. Second, this was a pilot trial and was not designed to test between-group differences with high levels of statistical power. Type 2 errors are likely to have occurred, and a larger trial is now underway to test for robust effects and replicate signals of effectiveness in important secondary outcomes such as loneliness. In this study, we observed that BA is a credible intervention to mitigate the psychological impacts of COVID-19 isolation for older adults. We demonstrated that it is feasible to undertake a trial of BA. The intervention can be delivered remotely and at scale, but should be reserved for older adults with evidence of depressive symptoms. The significant reduction in loneliness is unlikely to be a chance finding, and replication will be explored in a fully powered randomised controlled trial (RCT).

Local injection site reactions, select systemic symptoms, and adverse events (AEs) were recorded. Immunogenicity was assessed by measuring serotype-specific opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) titers before and approximately 1 month after each vaccination.

The authors included active participants enrolled in the longitudinal Thinking and Living With Cancer study of nonmetastatic breast cancer survivors aged 60 to 89 years (n = 262) and matched controls (n = 165) from 5 US regions. Participants completed questionnaires at parent study enrollment and then annually, including a web-based or telephone COVID-19 survey, between May 27 and September 11, 2020. Mixed-effects models were used to examine changes in loneliness (a single item on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression [CES-D] scale) from before to during the pandemic in survivors versus controls and to test survivor-control differences in the associations between changes in loneliness and changes in mental health, including depression (CES-D, excluding the loneliness item), anxiety (the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory), and perceived stress (the Perceived Stress Scale). Models were adjusted for age, race, county COVID-19 death rates, and time between assessments. Loneliness increased from before to during the pandemic (0.211; P = .001), with no survivor-control differences.

Cancer survivors reported changes in loneliness and mental health similar to those reported by women without cancer.

{"id": "34519661", "data": "A Web-Based Intervention (Germ Defence) to Increase Handwashing During a Pandemic: Process Evaluations of a Randomized Controlled Trial and Public Dissemination. Washing hands helps prevent transmission of seasonal and pandemic respiratory viruses. In a randomized controlled trial (RCT) during the swine flu outbreak, participants with access to a fully automated, digital intervention promoting handwashing reported washing their hands more often and experienced fewer respiratory tract infections than those without access to the intervention. Based on these findings, the intervention was adapted, renamed as Germ Defence, and a study was designed to assess the preliminary dissemination of the intervention to the general public to help prevent the spread of seasonal colds and flu. This study compares the process evaluations of the RCT and Germ Defence dissemination to examine (1) how web-based research enrollment procedures affected those who used the intervention, (2) intervention usage in the 2 contexts, and (3) whether increased intentions to wash hands are replicated once disseminated. The RCT ran between 2010 and 2012 recruiting participants offline from general practices, with restricted access to the intervention (N=9155). Germ Defence was disseminated as an open access website for use by the general public from 2016 to 2019 (N=624). The process evaluation plan was developed using Medical Research Council guidance and the framework for Analyzing and Measuring Usage and Engagement Data. Both interventions contained a goal-setting section where users self-reported current and intended handwashing behavior across 7 situations. During web-based enrolment, 54.3% (17,511/32,250) of the RCT participants dropped out of the study compared to 36.5% (358/982) of Germ Defence users.

By comparing the preliminary dissemination of Germ Defence to the RCT, we were able to examine the potential effects of the research procedures on uptake and attrition such as the sizeable dropout during the RCT enrolment procedure that may have led to a more motivated sample. The Germ Defence study highlighted the points of attrition within the intervention. Despite sample bias in the trial context, the intervention replicated increases in intentions to handwash when used in the wild.

Aloe vera is a functional food with various pharmacological functions, including an immune-modulating effect. Until now, A. vera has never been studied as an adjuvant in influenza vaccine, and its effects on upper respiratory tract infection (URI) are unknown. The objective of our study was to investigate the effect of processed A. vera gel (PAG) on immunogenicity of quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine and URI in healthy adults. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was performed. This study was conducted in 100 healthy adults at a single center from September 2017 to May 2018. Subjects were randomly divided into a PAG group (n = 50) and a placebo group (n = 50). The enrolled subjects were instructed to ingest the study drug for 8 weeks. The participants received a single dose of quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine after taking the study drug for the first 4 weeks of the study. The primary endpoint was seroprotection rate against at least one viral strain at 4 weeks post-vaccination. Other outcomes were seroprotection rate at 24 weeks post-vaccination, seroconversion rate, geometric mean fold increase (GMFI) at 4 and 24 weeks post-vaccination, seroprotection rate ratio and geometric mean titer ratio (GMTR) at 4 weeks post-vaccination between PAG and placebo groups, and incidence, severity, and duration of URI. The European Committee for proprietary medicinal products (CPMP) evaluation criteria were met at least one in the PAG and placebo groups for all strains. However, there was no significant difference in the seroprotection rate at 4 weeks post-vaccination against all strains in both PAG and placebo groups. Among secondary endpoints, the GMFI at 4 weeks post-vaccination for the A/H3N2 was significantly higher in the PAG than in placebo group. The GMTR as adjuvant effect was 1.382 (95% CI, 1.014-1.1883). Kaplan-Meier curve analysis showed a reduction in incidence of URI (p = 0.035), and a generalized estimating equation model identified a decrease in repeated URI events (odds ratio 0.57; 95% CI, 0.39-0.83; p = 0.003) in the PAG group.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 may cause low oxygen saturation (SpO2) and respiratory failure in patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Hence, increased SpO2 levels in COVID-19 patients could be crucial for their quality of life and recovery. This study aimed to demonstrate that a 30-minute single session of dorsal low-field thoracic magnetic stimulation (LF-ThMS) can be employed to increase SpO2 levels in COVID-19 patients significantly. Furthermore, we hypothesized that the variables associated with LF-ThMS, such as frequency, magnetic flux density, and temperature in the dorsal thorax, might be correlated to SpO2 levels in these patients.Here we employed an LF-ThMS device to noninvasively deliver a pulsed magnetic field from 100 to 118 Hz and 10.5 to 13.1 milliTesla (i.e., 105 to 131 Gauss) to the dorsal thorax. These values are within the intensity range of several pulsed electromagnetic field devices employed in physical therapy worldwide. We designed a single-blind, sham-controlled, crossover study on 5 COVID-19 patients who underwent 2 sessions of the study (real and sham LF-ThMS) and 12 patients who underwent only the real LF-ThMS.We found a statistically significant positive correlation between magnetic flux density, frequency, or temperature, associated with the real LF-ThMS and SpO2 levels in all COVID-19 patients.

This study aimed to determine the effects of progressive muscle relaxation exercises on the anxiety and sleep quality of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is an experimental study. Its data were collected in the infectious diseases clinic of a research hospital from May to August, 2020. This study was carried out with 67 COVID-19 patients (33 in the experimental group and 34 in the control group). The data were collected using a personal information form, the state-trait anxiety inventory, and the Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire. The progressive muscle relaxation exercises were performed twice a day for 5 days with the researcher's supervision. The data were analyzed using means, numbers, percentage distributions, the χ  2  test, the dependent t test, and the independent t test. Statistically significant differences were found between the experimental and control groups' mean posttest scores on the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and the Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire (p < 0.05). The in-group comparison of the experimental group found a statistically significant difference between their mean pretest and posttest scores on the State Anxiety Scale (p < 0.05). The in-group comparison of the control group found no statistically significant changes in their mean pretest and posttest scores on the State Anxiety Scale (p > 0.05).

Px563L is a next-generation anthrax vaccine candidate consisting of a protein subunit, mutant recombinant protective antigen SNKE167-ΔFF-315-E308D (mrPA), and liposome-embedded monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA) adjuvant. Px563L has the potential to deliver an improved safety and immunogenicity profile relative to the currently licensed vaccine, which is produced from filtered B. anthracis culture supernatants. We conducted a Phase 1, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study in 54 healthy subjects to evaluate Px563L at 3 dose levels of mrPA (10, 50, and 80 mcg). For each dose level, 18 subjects were randomized in an 8:8:2 ratio to Px563L (mrPA with adjuvant), RPA563 (mrPA only) or placebo (saline). Each subject received an intramuscular (IM) injection on Day 0 and Day 28. Primary safety and immunogenicity analysis was conducted after all subjects completed the Day70 visit, a duration deemed clinically relevant for post-exposure prophylaxis. Long-term safety was assessed through Day 393. Vaccinations with Px563L at all dose levels were well-tolerated. There were no serious adverse events or adverse events (AE) leading to early withdrawal. In all treatment groups, most AEs were due to injection site reactions, and all AEs at the 10 and 50 mcg dose levels were mild. For the primary immunogenicity endpoint (protective toxin neutralizing antibody 50% neutralization factor [TNA NF50]), titers started to increase significantly after the second administration of Px563L, from Day35 through Day70, with the geometric mean and lower bound of the 95% confidence interval exceeding 0.56, a threshold correlating with significant survival in animal models of anthrax exposure. In conclusion, Px563L, administered as two IM doses 28 days apart, was well-tolerated and elicited a protective antibody response starting at seven days after the second vaccination. These findings support the continued development of Px563L in a two-dose regimen for anthrax post-exposure prophylaxis.

Using a more stringent CHMI, with heterologous parasites (different P. falciparum strain), we assessed the impact of higher PfSPZ doses, a novel multi-dose prime regimen, and a delayed vaccine boost upon vaccine efficacy (VE).

Mass drug administration (MDA) with azithromycin (AZ) is being considered as a strategy to promote child survival in sub-Saharan Africa, but the mechanism by which AZ reduces mortality is unclear. To better understand the nature and extent of protection provided by AZ, we explored the profile of protection by time since administration, using data from a household-randomized, placebo-controlled trial in Burkina Faso and Mali. Between 2014 and 2016, 30 977 children aged 3-59 months received seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC) with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine plus amodiaquine and either AZ or placebo monthly, on 4 occasions each year. Poisson regression with gamma-distributed random effects, accounting for the household randomization and within-individual clustering of illness episodes, was used to compare incidence of prespecified outcomes between SMC+AZ versus SMC+placebo groups in fixed time strata post-treatment. The likelihood ratio test was used to assess evidence for a time-treatment group interaction. Relative to SMC+placebo, there was no evidence of protection from SMC+AZ against hospital admissions and deaths. Additional protection from SMC+AZ against malaria was confined to the first 2 weeks post-administration (protective efficacy (PE): 24.2% [95% CI: 17.8%, 30.1%]).

A sample of 176 clients about to start or restart ART were randomized (83 to START, 93 to usual care) at HIV clinics in the Los Angeles area. Primary outcomes included electronically monitored dose-taking adherence and HIV viral load; primary end points were months 6 and 24, with group differences examined using nonresponse-weighted means or proportions, effect sizes, and significance testing. Item nonresponse was addressed using multiple imputation. 166 (94.3%) participants started ART, of whom 124 (74.7%) were still in care at month 6, and 90 (54.2%) at month 24. In comparison to the usual care control group, the START group had higher dose-taking adherence at month 6 (86.2% vs. 71.6%, d = 0.56, p = 0.01), which was sustained through month 24 (86.0% vs. 61.1%, d =1.01, p < 0.0001).

To address this gap, we developed and tested nationally, InThistoGether (ITG), a text messaging-based HIV prevention program for 18-22 year-old Ugandan youth. To assess feasibility and acceptability, and preliminary indications of behavior change, a randomized controlled trial was conducted with 202 youth.

Twelve weeks later, the intervention ended with a one-week 'booster' that reviewed the main program topics. Measures were assessed at baseline and intervention end, 5 months post-randomization. Results suggest that ITG is feasible: The retention rate was 83%. Ratings for the content and program features met acceptability thresholds; program experience ratings were mixed. ITG also was associated with significantly higher rates of condom-protected sex (aIRR = 1.68, p < 0.001) and odds of HIV testing (aOR = 2.41, p = 0.03) compared to the control group. The odds of abstinence were similar by experimental arm however (aOR = 1.08, p = 0.86). Together, these data suggest reason for optimism that older adolescent Ugandans are willing to engage in an intensive, text messaging-based HIV prevention programming.

This stepped-wedge cluster-randomized controlled trial aimed to determine the causal impact of immediate ART initiation on patients' healthcare expenditures in Eswatini. Fourteen healthcare facilities were randomly assigned to transition at one of seven time points from the standard of care (ART eligibility below a CD4 count threshold) to the immediate ART for all intervention (EAAA). 2261 patients living with HIV were interviewed over the study period to capture their past-year out-of-pocket healthcare expenditures. In mixed-effects regression models, we found a 49% decrease (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.36, 0.72, p < 0.001) in past-year total healthcare expenditures in the EAAA group compared to the standard of care, and a 98% (RR 0.02, 95% CI 0.00, 0.02, p < 0.001) decrease in spending on private and traditional healthcare. Despite a higher frequency of HIV care visits for newly initiated ART patients, immediate ART initiation appears to have lowered patients' healthcare expenditures because they sought less care from alternative healthcare providers.

Según los modelos de regresión de efectos mixtos, se observó un descenso del 49% (RR: 0,51; IC del 95%: 0,36, 0,72; p<0,001) en el gasto sanitario total del año anterior en el grupo de la EAAA, y un descenso del 98% (RR 0,02; IC del 95%: 0,00, 0,02; p<0,001) en el gasto en asistencia sanitaria privada y tradicional. A pesar de una mayor frecuencia de visitas deatención de VIH para los pacientes que recién comenzaron laTAR, la aplicación inmediata de laTAR redujo los gastos sanitarios de los pacientes dado que buscaron menos atención de proveedores de asistencia sanitaria alternativos. Este estudio añade un importante argumento económico a la recomendación de la Organización Mundial de la Salud de abolir las restricciones de elegibilidad para la terapia antirretroviral basados en el recuento de CD4.", "label": [[64, 97, "X"], [821, 868, "X"], [14, 60, "I"], [442, 466, "I"], [470, 503, "X"], [517, 547, "P"], [622, 684, "C"], [692, 733, "I"], [740, 764, "P"], [1175, 1405, "B"]]}
{"id": "34587971", "data": "Behavioral effects of different contraceptive methods and HIV acquisition: an ancillary study of the ECHO randomized trial. The ECHO trial randomised 7829 women to depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA-IM), the copper intrauterine device (IUD) and the levonorgestrel (LNG) implant (1:1:1) and found no clear difference in HIV incidence between these three groups. We have previously hypothesized that oligo-amenorrhoea induced by DMPA-IM may have a protective effect on HIV acquisition. The aim of this ancillary study was to assess the effects of DMPA-IM, the IUD and the LNG implant on menstrual symptoms and sexual behavior and to correlate these with HIV acquisition. At the Effective Care Research Unit (ECRU) in South Africa, of 615 women already randomised to DMPA-IM, the copper IUD and the LNG implant (1:1:1) 552 agreed to participate. Participants completed a 28-day symptom and behavior diary following their one-month ECHO trial visit and returning it at their 3-month follow-up visit. HIV acquisition data were retrieved from ECHO trial records. Of 552 women enrolled on the ancillary study, 390 (70.6%) completed their daily diary; 130, 133, and 127 received DMPA-IM, IUD, and LNG implant, respectively. Thirty-three (5.9%) of these women acquired HIV. Women on the progestin-only contraceptives were more likely to experience amenorrhoea, as expected, and were less likely to have intra-menstrual coitus than IUD users (p < 0.001 for DMPA-IM vs IUD and p = 0.002 for implant vs IUD). Overall coital frequency was highest and condom usage lowest among DMPA-IM users. Intra-menstrual coitus correlated positively, and duration of menstruation correlated negatively, with HIV acquisition, although these effects were not statistically significant (p = 0.09 and p = 0.079, respectively). Findings support the hypothesis that oligo-amenorrhoea and the associated reduced intra-menstrual coitus may mitigate the potential for an increased biological risk of HIV acquisition with DMPA-IM but more evidence is needed. Study registration number PACTR201706001651380. There have been concerns that the depot-medroxyprogesterone acetate injection (DMPA-IM) may increase the risk of getting HIV infection. However, a large multicenter randomized study, the ECHO trial, recently compared HIV incidence among women randomized to DMPA-IM, the copper intrauterine device (IUD) and the levonorgestrel (LNG) implant and found little difference in HIV risk between these methods. DMPA-IM often causes no or scanty menstruation; we hypothesized that this may have a protective effect on getting HIV, by reducing exposure to HIV during menstrual bleeding.This ancillary study was done among ECHO trial participants at one of the ECHO study sites in South Africa. The aim was to assess the effects of the three different contraceptives on menstrual symptoms and sexual behavior and to correlate these with the risk of getting HIV. The study required women to complete a 28-day daily symptom and behavior diary after their one-month ECHO trial follow-up visit.We found that fewer women had sex during their periods with DMPA-IM and the LNG implant than the copper IUD, probably because no or scanty menstruation is more common with both DMPA-IM and the implant. Although effects were not statistically significant, having sex during periods tended to have a higher risk of getting HIV and longer periods indicated a lower risk of getting HIV.We concluded that sexual behavior related to menstruation may influence HIV acquisition and may partially explain why the ECHO trial found little difference in HIV incidence between the three contraceptives assessed despite observational evidence of higher biological risk with DMPA related to immune suppression.", "label": [[58, 73, "X"], [590, 672, "X"], [861, 999, "X"], [1001, 1060, "X"], [0, 18, "X"], [22, 53, "I"], [155, 160, "P"], [164, 282, "I"], [550, 586, "I"], [741, 746, "P"], [769, 812, "I"], [1802, 2027, "B"]]}

We tested the efficacy of a theory-based intervention to increase adherence to federal aerobic and muscle-strengthening physical activity (PA) guidelines among African American men aged 40 years and older living with HIV. We randomized African American men aged 40 years and older living with HIV to a three-session social cognitive theory-informed health promotion intervention targeting PA or a one-session health awareness control condition. The primary outcome was PA guideline adherence assessed (self-reported) preintervention, immediate postintervention, and 3, 6, and 12 months postintervention. Secondary outcomes were the number of days on which participants reported moderate-intensity aerobic PA, vigorous-intensity aerobic PA, and muscle-strengthening PA in the past 7 days. Of 302 participants, 255 completed the 12-month postintervention measures. Generalized estimated equation logistic regression indicated that the health promotion intervention participants had higher odds of meeting PA guidelines than health awareness control participants, adjusting for baseline adherence (p = 0.011).

This is the first prospective study to evaluate the 5-year outcomes of patients with RAKI, and assess the effect of sodium bicarbonate (SB) in the long-term outcomes of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) undergoing non-emergent coronary angiography. 382 CKD stage III-IV patients undergoing elective non-emergent coronary angiography were randomized to SB (n = 192) or normal saline (NS) solution (n = 190). Incidence of RAKI, in-hospital, 1- and 5-year mortality and renal replacement therapy (RRT), and 5-year major adverse renal and cardiovascular events (MARCE) were compared between groups. Outcomes of patient with and without RAKI were compared after five-years of prospective follow-up. Multivariate predictors of RAKI and death at 5-years were determined. The use of SB did not improve the incidence of RAKI, in-hospital outcomes, survival, and freedom from RRT or MARCE after 5-years of follow-up.

Restoration of human brain function after injury is a signal challenge for translational neuroscience.

We extended these findings to adult humans with stroke in a randomized controlled trial applying the essential elements of rodent motor training paradigms to humans. Stroke patients were adaptively randomized to begin 20 extra hours of self-selected, task-specific motor therapy at ≤30 d (acute), 2 to 3 mo (subacute), or ≥6 mo (chronic) after stroke, compared with controls receiving standard motor rehabilitation. Upper extremity (UE) impairment assessed by the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) was measured at up to five time points. The primary outcome measure was ARAT recovery over 1 y after stroke. By 1 y we found significantly increased UE motor function in the subacute group compared with controls (ARAT difference = +6.87 ± 2.63, P = 0.009).

Background Effective secondary prevention is essential for reducing stroke recurrence. Objective This parallel randomized-controlled study aimed to evaluate the impact of a pharmaceutical care program on risk factor control (blood pressure, blood glucose, lipid profile, and medication adherence) and hospital readmissions in post-stroke care. Setting The First Hospital of Hebei Medical University, China. Method Ischemic stroke patients were enrolled in the study. Upon hospital discharge, patients were randomly allocated either to a control group (CG, no pharmaceutical care) or to an intervention group (IG, monthly pharmaceutical care follow-up for 6 months). The interventions aimed to increase medication adherence and improve risk factor control through education and counseling. Medication adherence and surrogate laboratory markers of risk factors were assessed and compared between the two groups. Main outcome measures Blood pressure, blood glucose, lipid profile, and medication adherence. Results A total of 184 patients with ischemic strokes were randomly assigned, and 84 patients in IG and 82 in CG were analyzed. There were no significant differences (P > 0.05) in both groups concerning demographic and clinical characteristics. Compared to CG, at the 6-month follow-up, medication adherence rates significantly increased regarding antihypertensive drugs (92.86% versus 78.57%, P = 0.031), anti-diabetic drugs (91.67% versus 69.7%, P = 0.02), and lipid-lowering drugs (77.38% versus 60.98%, P = 0.022) in IG.

Improvement of balance and postural stability is an important goal in stroke rehabilitation. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a shoe lift under the nonparetic leg on balance function and balance confidence in persons with chronic stroke. Thirty-six individuals with chronic stroke (21 males and 15 females), who were able to walk independently and showed stance asymmetry, were randomized to a shoe insert and a control group. The interventions included a 6-week balance training program, in conjunction with a shoe lift under the nonaffected leg (shoe insert group, n = 18), or balance training alone (control group, n = 18). The outcome measures were weight-bearing asymmetry (WBA), root mean square (RMS) of anterior-posterior (AP) and medial-lateral (ML) center-of-pressure (COP) velocity asymmetry, Berg Balance Scale (BBS), and Activities-specific Balance Confidence (ABC) Scale. These were measured in both groups at baseline, after the intervention, and at a 3-month follow-up. A repeated-measure multivariate analysis of variance was conducted to evaluate the impact of 2 different interventions on balance measures, across the 3 periods. No significant between-group differences were found for demographics and stroke-related characteristics of participants (P > .05). The outcome measures between the 2 groups were not significantly different at baseline (P > .05). There were between-group differences for WBA and the RMS of AP COP velocity asymmetry after the intervention and at the 3-month follow-up (P < .05). No significant difference in the RMS of ML COP velocity asymmetry, BBS, and ABC was identified between the 2 groups after the intervention and at the 3-month follow-up (P > .05).

The corticospinal tract (CST) is a crucial brain pathway for distal arm and hand motor control.

We analyzed clinical and neuroimaging data from a randomized controlled rehabilitation trial. Participants completed clinical assessments and neuroimaging at baseline and clinical assessments 4 months later, postintervention. Using univariate linear regression analysis, we determined the linear relationship between the DTI-derived CST fractional anisotropy asymmetry (FAasym) and the percentage of baseline change in log-transformed average Wolf Motor Function Test time for distal items (ΔlnWMFT-distal_%). The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) linear regressions with cross-validation and bootstrapping were used to determine the relative weighting of CST FAasym, other brain metrics, clinical outcomes, and demographics on distal motor improvement. Logistic regression analyses were performed to test whether the CST FAasym can predict clinically significant UE motor improvement. lnWMFT-distal significantly improved at the group level. Baseline CST FAasym explained 26% of the variance in ΔlnWMFT-distal_%. A multivariate LASSO model including baseline CST FAasym, age, and UE Fugl-Meyer explained 39% of the variance in ΔlnWMFT-distal_%.

A proof-of-concept randomised controlled trial. Exercise therapy and neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) during the initial 14 days after stroke may benefit recovery of gait. We aimed to determine whether poststroke NMES of vastus medial and tibial muscles during exercise therapy is more effective than exercise therapy alone. In this proof-of-concept randomised trial patients with first-ever acute ischemic stroke and a leg paresis (40-85 years of age) were randomised (1:1) to 10 min of daily NMES + exercise therapy or exercise therapy alone. Primary outcome was the between-group difference in change in 6 min Walk Test (6MWT) at 90 days post stroke estimated with a mixed regression model. Secondary outcomes included 10 m Walk Test, Fugl-Meyer Motor Assessment, Guralnik Timed Standing Balance, Sit to Stand, Timed Up and Go, EQ-5D-5L, Montreal Cognitive Assessment and Becks Depression Inventory. 50 stroke survivors (25 in each group) with a mean age of 67 years (range 43-83) were included.

Premutation-sized (55-200) CGG repeat expansions in the FMR1 gene cause fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). Most studies of premutation carriers utilized reverse ascertainment to identify patients, leading to a selection bias for larger repeats. As shorter CGG premutation repeats are common in the population, understanding their impact on health outcomes has a potentially large public health footprint. The study's objective was to compare an unselected group of premutation carriers (n = 35, 55-101 CGG repeats) with matched controls (n = 61, 29-39 CGG repeats) with respect to FXTAS-type signs using structured neurological assessments.

People with Multiple Sclerosis (PwMS) experience a wide range of symptoms that can alter function and limit activity and community participation. Symptoms including sensory changes, weakness, fatigue and others have been well documented. However, symptoms related to changes in vestibular related function, including gaze and postural stability have not been fully explored. While some recent studies have begun to provide insight into these deficits in PwMS and have explored the use of rehabilitation paradigms for their management, much remains unknown about the full extent of these deficits. Therefore, this study aimed to characterize the presence of gaze and postural stability deficits in measures across the World Health Organization International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (WHO ICF) and to examine how deficits in domains of body structure and function and activity contribute to participation level limitations. Baseline data from 41 PwMS (mean(SD) age = 53.9(11.2), 78% female) enrolled as part of a randomized clinical trial were used in this analysis. Measures of gaze and postural stability from the ICF domains of body structure and function (Vestibular ocular reflex [VOR] gain and postural sway area), activity (computerized dynamic visual acuity [cDVA] and MiniBEST test), and participation (Dizziness handicap inventory [DHI] and Activities Balance Confidence [ABC] scale) along with demographic data were used to characterize the sample. To explore relationships between ICF domains for gaze and postural stability, univariate correlations were performed between measures from each domain using Pearson's correlations. Separate multivariate regression models examined how measures from the body structure and function and activity domains contributed to the variance in the participation level outcomes. Variance explained by the models was quantified using R-squared statistic and contribution of the independent variables were quantified using the beta coefficient (p < 0.05). Correlation analysis demonstrated significant relationships in the postural stability measures across domains. Specifically, between postural sway area on a firm surface and MiniBEST test score (r = -.48;p < 0.01) and MiniBEST test score and ABC score (r = 0.5;p < 0.01). Significant correlations were also found between the gaze stability measures of horizontal and vertical VOR gain (r = .68;p < 0.001), horizontal VOR gain and dynamic visual acuity (r = .38;p = 0.02), and vertical VOR gain and dynamic visual acuity (r = .54;p < 0.001). Regression models assessing postural stability, found that only the MiniBEST score significantly contributed to the variance in ABC score (p = 0.01) and the full model explained 34% of the variance in ABC score. Regression modeling of gaze stability outcomes did not produce any variable that significantly contributed to the variance in DHI score and the full model explained 18% of the variance in DHI score. PwMS in this sample demonstrated deficits in gaze and postural stability across the domains of the WHO ICF compared to past samples of PwMS and healthy cohorts. Correlation between measures in the different domains were present, but no strong relationship between measures of body structure and function, activity and participation level outcomes were observed.

Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) is a form of behavioural therapy for tics; however, its effectiveness remains uncertain. We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of internet-delivered, therapist-supported, and parent-assisted ERP for treatment of tics in children and young people with Tourette syndrome or chronic tic disorder. This multicentre, parallel group, single-blind, randomised controlled trial was conducted across two study sites in England. Participants were recruited via 16 patient identification centres, two study sites in England (Nottingham and London), or online self-referral. Eligible participants were aged 9-17 years, had Tourette syndrome or chronic tic disorder, had not received behavioural therapy for tics in the past 12 months or were about to start, and had a Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS) Total Tic Severity Score (TTSS) of more than 15 or more than 10 if they had only motor or vocal tics. Patients were excluded if they had started or stopped medication for tics within the past 2 months; had current alcohol or substance dependence, psychosis, suicidality, anorexia nervosa, or suspected moderate to severe intellectual disability; or presented an immediate risk to self or others; or the parent or carer was unable to speak, read, or write in English. Eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1) by masked outcome assessors to receive 10 weeks of online, remotely delivered, therapist-supported ERP or psychoeducation (active control). Outcome assessors, statisticians, health economists, the trial manager, and the chief investigator were masked to group allocation. Patients were not directly informed of their allocation, but this could be established from the content once treatment commenced and the patients were not, therefore, considered masked to treatment. The primary outcome was YGTSS-TTSS 3 months after randomisation, and analysis was done in all randomised patients for whom data were available for each timepoint and outcome. Safety analysis was by intention to treat. Longer term follow-up is ongoing. This trial is registered with ISRCTN (ISRCTN70758207) and ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03483493). Between May 8, 2018, and Sept 30, 2019, we assessed 445 candidates for inclusion in the study. 221 potential participants were excluded (90 did not meet inclusion criteria, 84 declined to participate, and 47 unable to contact family). 224 participants were enrolled and randomly assigned to ERP (n=112) or psychoeducation (n=112). The enrolled patients were mostly male (n=177; 79%) and of White ethnicity (n=195; 87%). 11 patients were lost to follow-up 3 months after randomisation in the ERP group, compared with 12 patients in the psychoeducation group. Mean YGTSS-TTSS at 3 months after randomisation was 23·9 (SD 8·2) in the ERP group and 26·8 (7·3) in the psychoeducation group. The mean total decrease in YGTSS-TTSS at 3 months was 4·5 (16%, SD 1·1) in the ERP group versus 1·6 (6%, 1·0) in the psychoeducation group. The estimated mean difference in YGTSS-TTSS change between the groups adjusted for baseline and site was -2·29 points (95% CI -3·86 to -0·71) in favour of ERP, with an effect size of -0·31 (95% CI -0·52 to -0·10).

Agitated and aggressive behaviors (behaviors) are common in nursing home (NH) residents with dementia. Medications commonly used to manage behaviors have dangerous side effects. NHs are adopting non-pharmacological interventions to manage behaviors, despite a lack of effectiveness evidence and an understanding of optimal implementation strategies. We are conducting an adaptive trial to evaluate the effects of personalized music on behaviors. Adaptive trials may increase efficiency and reduce costs associated with traditional RCTs by learning and making modifications to the trial while it is ongoing. We are conducting two consecutive parallel cluster-randomized trials with 54 NHs in each trial (27 treatment, 27 control). Participating NHs were recruited from 4 corporations which differ in size, ownership structure, geography, and residents' racial composition. After randomization, there were no significant differences between the NHs randomized to each trial with respect to baseline behaviors, number of eligible residents, degree of cognitive impairment, or antipsychotic use. Agitated behavior frequency is assessed via staff interviews (primary outcome), required nursing staff conducted resident assessments (secondary outcome), and direct observations of residents (secondary outcome). Between the two parallel trials, the adaptive design will be used to test alternative implementation strategies, increasingly enroll residents who are likely to benefit from the intervention, and seamlessly conduct a stage III/IV trial. This adaptive trial allows investigators to estimate the impact of a popular non-pharmaceutical intervention (personalized music) on residents' behaviors, under pragmatic, real-world conditions testing two implementation strategies. This design has the potential to reduce the research timeline by improving the likelihood of powered results, increasingly enrolling residents most likely to benefit from intervention, sequentially assessing the effectiveness of implementation strategies in the same trial, and creating a statistical model to reduce the future need for onsite data collection. The design may also increase research equity by enrolling and tailoring the intervention to populations otherwise excluded from research.

The Life-Space Assessment (LSA) quantified the extent, frequency, and independence across 5 expanding levels of home and community mobility, producing individual subscores and a total score. Two additional summed scores were used to represent mobility within (Levels 1-3) and beyond (Levels 4-5) neighborhood limits. An accelerometer measured walking activity for 7 days. Regression and correlation analyses evaluated relationships between daily steps and mobility scores. Mann-Whitney U tests secondarily compared differences in mobility scores between the active and sedentary groups.

Common adverse events (n = 66): nausea (10.7%), dizziness (7.1%), dry mouth (7.1%), headache (7.1%), anxiety (5.4%), constipation (5.4%), dyspepsia (5.4%). ESS decreased both placebo (-4.78) and solriamfetol (-4.82 to -5.72; P > 0.05). MWT improved dose-dependently with solriamfetol, increasing by 5.05 minutes with 300 mg relative to placebo (P = 0.0098). Safety/tolerability was consistent with solriamfetol's known profile. There were no significant improvements on ESS; MWT results suggest possible benefit with solriamfetol in PD. © 2021 The Authors.

Preclinical data suggest that a hypoadenosinergic state plays an important pathogenetic role. The objective of this study was to determine whether inhibitors of equilibrative nucleoside transporters, for example, dipyridamole, could provide effective symptomatic treatment. A 2-week double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study assessed the efficacy of dipyridamole (possible up-titration to 300 mg) in untreated patients with idiopathic restless legs syndrome. Multiple suggested immobilization tests and polysomnography were performed after each treatment phase. Severity was assessed weekly using the International Restless Legs Rating Scale, Clinical Global Impression, and the Medical Outcomes Study Sleep scale. The primary end point was therapeutic response. Twenty-eight of 29 patients recruited were included. International Restless Legs Rating Scale scores improved from a mean ± standard deviation of 24.1 ± 3.1 at baseline to 11.1 ± 2.3 at the end of week 2, versus 23.7 ± 3.4 to 18.7 ± 3.2 under placebo (P < 0.001). Clinical Global Impression, Medical Outcomes Study Sleep, and Multiple Suggested Immobilization Test scores all improved (P < 0.001). The mean effective dose of dipyridamole was 217.8 ± 33.1 mg/d. Sleep variables improved. The mean periodic leg movement index at the end of treatment with dipyridamole was 8.2 ± 3.5 versus. 28.1 ± 6.7 under placebo. Side effects (dipyridamole vs placebo) included abdominal distension (18% vs. 7%), dizziness (10.7% vs 7.1%), diarrhea, and asthenia (each 7.1% vs 3.6%). Dipyridamole has significant therapeutic effects on both sensory and motor symptoms of restless legs syndrome and on sleep. Our findings confirm the efficacy of dipyridamole in restless legs syndrome predicted from preclinical studies and support a key role of adenosine in restless legs syndrome. © 2021 The Authors.

Trazodone and cognitive-behavioural treatment for insomnia (CBT-I) are widely used to treat patients with chronic insomnia. Although both treatments improve sleep continuity, no study has compared their comparative effectiveness in modifying spectral electroencephalographic (EEG) activity during sleep in humans. In this study, participants included 19 men and women with chronic insomnia who were randomized to either trazodone (n = 8) or CBT-I (n = 11) treatment for 3 months. We examined delta (0.39-3.91 Hz), theta (4.30-7.81 Hz), alpha (8.20-11.72 Hz), sigma (12.11-14.84 Hz), beta (15.23-35.16 Hz) and gamma (35.55-49.61 Hz) relative power during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep at pre-treatment, 3- month post-treatment and 6-month follow-up.

One of these complications is sleep disorders including insomnia disorder that can affect all aspects of personal life. The present study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) on insomnia severity and sleep quality among postmenopausal women. This was a randomised clinical trial in which 46 women were recruited and randomly allocated into two groups, one receiving CBT-I and a control group. The CBT-I group received six sessions of training, while the control group received only usual care.

The ISI and PSQI were measured at baseline, 3 and 6 weeks after intervention, and in a 4-week follow-up. The Independent t test, the chi-square test, generalised estimating equation models, and Bonferroni correction were applied to analyse the data. According to our results, in the CBT-I group compared to the control group, the mean ISI, PSQI, sleep onset latency, sleep time, and sleep quality score reduced continuously from baseline to week 3 and from week 3 to week 6, and remained constant from week 6 to week 10.

This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of ultrasound-guided transmuscular quadratus lumborum block (QLB) combined with local infiltration analgesia (LIA) for pain management and recovery in patients who have undergone total hip arthroplasty (THA) via a posterolateral approach. This was a prospective, randomized controlled trial. We collected data in the preoperative area, operating room, and bed ward. A total of 80 patients with American Society of Anesthesiology functional status scores of II-III were included and assigned to two groups, and all 80 patients were included in the final analysis. All included patients were randomly assigned to the nerve block (group N) or the control group (group C). Patients in the group N received transmuscular QLB combined with LIA, while patients in the group C received only LIA. The primary outcome was postoperative pain during the first active motion: it was measured at six hours after surgery and assessed using a visual analog scale (VAS). Secondary outcomes were the resting VAS scores in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) and at 2, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h after surgery; VAS scores during motion at 12, 24, 48, and 72 h after surgery; intraoperative consumption of opioids; postoperative consumption of morphine hydrochloride; frequency of sleep interruption due to pain on the night of surgery; time until the first walk out of the bed after surgery; muscle strength of the quadriceps femoris; and postoperative adverse effects.

Catheter-related bladder discomfort (CRBD) is postoperative distress caused by a urinary catheter. CRBD is related to muscarinic receptor activation. Chlorpheniramine has antimuscarinic properties. Hence, this investigation was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of chlorpheniramine in preventing CRBD in patients undergoing transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT). Seventy-six patients scheduled for TURBT under general anesthesia were assigned into two groups. In the chlorpheniramine group (n = 38), 100 ml normal saline containing 0.1 mg/kg chlorpheniramine was infused after general anesthesia induction. In the control group (n = 38), 100 ml normal saline alone was infused. The incidence and severity of CRBD were assessed at 1, 6, and 24 h postoperatively. The 1-h postoperative incidence of CRBD was lower in the chlorpheniramine group based on the unadjusted analysis [16 (42%) vs. 28 (74%), risk difference 32%, 95% confidence interval 8-51, p = 0.005]. After adjusting the size of the urinary catheter, post hoc analysis showed that the 1-h postoperative incidence of CRBD was lower in the chlorpheniramine group (p = 0.004). The CRBD severity score was lower in the chlorpheniramine group at 1 and 6 h after operation based on the unadjusted analysis (p = 0.012 and p = 0.007, respectively). After adjusting the urinary catheter size, post hoc analysis showed that 1- and 6-h CRBD severity score was lower in the chlorpheniramine group (p = 0.012 and p = 0.008, respectively). The incidence of rescue medication was lower in the chlorpheniramine group [10 (26%) vs. 20 (53%), risk difference 26%, 95% confidence interval 3-47, p = 0.019]. The overall incidence of complications such as nausea, vomiting, dry mouth, flushing, dizziness, and blurred vision was comparable between the two groups.

Chronic postoperative pain is common after breast cancer surgery. Peri-operative lidocaine infusion may prevent the development of chronic postoperative pain, but a large-scale trial is required to test this hypothesis. It is unclear whether a pragmatic, multicentre trial design that is consistent with expert guidance, addresses the limitations of previous studies, and overcomes existing translational barriers is safe, effective and feasible. We conducted a double-blind, randomised controlled pilot study in 150 patients undergoing breast cancer surgery across three hospitals in Western Australia. Patients received lidocaine, or equivalent volumes of saline, as an intravenous bolus (1.5 mg.kg -1  ) and infusion (2 mg.kg -1  .h -1  ) intra-operatively, and a subcutaneous infusion (1.33 mg.kg -1  .h -1  ) postoperatively for up to 12 h on a standard surgical ward, with novel safety monitoring tools in place. The co-primary outcomes were: in-hospital safety events; serum levels of lidocaine during intravenous and subcutaneous infusion; and annualised enrolment rates per site with long-term data capture. In-hospital safety events were rare, and similar in the placebo and lidocaine arms (3% vs. 1%).

An underlying cause of solid tumor resistance to chemotherapy treatment is diminished tumor blood supply, which leads to a hypoxic microenvironment, dependence on anaerobic energy metabolism, and impaired delivery of intravenous treatments. Preclinical data suggest that dietary strategies of caloric restriction and low-carbohydrate intake can inhibit glycolysis, while acute exercise can transiently enhance blood flow to the tumor and reduce hypoxia. The Diet Restriction and Exercise-induced Adaptations in Metastatic Breast Cancer (DREAM) study will compare the effects of a short-term, 50% calorie-restricted and ketogenic diet combined with aerobic exercise performed during intravenous chemotherapy treatment to usual care on changes in tumor burden, treatment side effects, and quality of life. Fifty patients with measurable metastases and primary breast cancer starting a new line of intravenous chemotherapy will be randomly assigned to usual care or the combined diet and exercise intervention. Participants assigned to the intervention group will be provided with food consisting of 50% of measured calorie needs with 80% of calories from fat and ≤ 10% from carbohydrates for 48-72 h prior to each chemotherapy treatment and will perform 30-60 min of moderate-intensity cycle ergometer exercise during each chemotherapy infusion, for up to six treatment cycles. The diet and exercise durations will be adapted for each chemotherapy protocol. Tumor burden will be assessed by change in target lesion size using axial computed tomography (primary outcome) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-derived apparent diffusion coefficient (secondary outcome) after up to six treatments. Tertiary outcomes will include quantitative MRI markers of treatment toxicity to the heart, thigh skeletal muscle, and liver, and patient-reported symptoms and quality of life. Exploratory outcome measures include progression-free and overall survival. The DREAM study will test a novel, short-term diet and exercise intervention that is targeted to mechanisms of tumor resistance to chemotherapy.

We sought to characterize longitudinal PROs and cosmesis in a randomized trial comparing conventionally fractionated (CF) versus hypofractionated (HF) WBI. From 2011 to 2014, women aged ≥40 years with Tis-T2 N0-N1a M0 breast cancer who underwent a lumpectomy with negative margins were randomized to CF-WBI (50 Gray [Gy]/25 fractions plus boost) versus HF-WBI (42.56 Gy/16 fractions plus boost). At baseline (pre-radiation), at 6 months, and yearly thereafter through 5 years, PROs included the Breast Cancer Treatment Outcome Scale (BCTOS), Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast (FACT-B), and Body Image Scale; cosmesis was reported by the treating physician using Radiation Therapy Oncology Group cosmesis values. Multivariable mixed-effects growth curve models evaluated associations of the treatment arm and patient factors with outcomes and tested for relevant interactions with the treatment arm. A total of 287 patients were randomized, completing a total of 14,801 PRO assessments.

BACKGROUND : Bleeding after endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is a severe adverse event. Several methods to prevent post-ESD bleeding (PEB) have been introduced; however, they have not been widely used because of technical difficulties. We aimed to investigate whether polysaccharide hemostatic powder (PHP), which is very easy to apply, can prevent early post-ESD bleeding, especially in patients with a high risk of post-ESD bleeding. METHODS : This was a prospective, multicenter, randomized, open-label, controlled trial. Patients with a high risk for post-ESD bleeding were enrolled. Patients with gastric neoplasms in whom the resected specimen size was expected to be > 40 mm and those who were regularly taking antithrombotic agents were defined as high risk patients. Patients were randomly assigned to the PHP or control groups. RESULTS:  Between May 2017 and September 2018, 143 patients were enrolled (PHP group, 73; control group, 70).

Amygdala-ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) circuitry is disrupted in pediatric anxiety disorders, yet how selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) affect this circuitry is unknown. We examined the impact of the SSRI escitalopram on functional connectivity (FC) within this circuit, and whether early FC changes predicted treatment response in adolescents with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Resting-state functional magnetic resonance (MR) images were acquired before and after 2 weeks of treatment in 41 adolescents with GAD (12-17 years of age) who received double-blind escitalopram or placebo for 8 weeks. Change in amygdala-based whole-brain FC and anxiety severity were analyzed. Controlling for age, sex, and pretreatment anxiety, escitalopram increased amygdala-VLPFC connectivity compared to placebo (F = 17.79, p = .002 FWE-corrected). This early FC change predicted 76.7% of the variability in improvement trajectory in patients who received escitalopram (p < .001) but not placebo (p = .169); the predictive power of early amygdala-VLPFC FC change significantly differed between placebo and escitalopram (p = .013). Furthermore, this FC change predicted improvement better than baseline FC or clinical/demographic characteristics. Exploratory analyses of amygdala subfields' FC revealed connectivity of left basolateral amygdala (BLA) -VLPFC (F = 19.64, p < .001 FWE-corrected) and superficial amygdala-posterior cingulate cortex (F = 22.92, p = .001 FWE-corrected) were also increased by escitalopram, but only BLA-VLPFC FC predicted improvement in anxiety over 8 weeks of treatment. In adolescents with GAD, escitalopram increased amygdala-prefrontal connectivity within the first 2 weeks of treatment, and the magnitude of this change predicted subsequent clinical improvement. Early normalization of amygdala-VLPFC circuitry might represent a useful tool for identifying future treatment responders as well as a promising biomarker for drug development.

Messages were sent via e-mail or in-account notification by on-line gambling operators and were designed to either: (1) be informative, describing the availability and purpose of the tool (informative messages), (2) highlight the benefits other people receive from using the tool (social messages) or (3) promote the benefit individuals could receive from using the tool (personal messages). A control group who did not receive messages was monitored for comparison. Our primary outcome was the number of customers who set a deposit limit within 5 days of receiving messages and secondary outcomes included pre- and post-message betting behaviour (e.g. average daily wager).

Understanding the complexities of obesity is important for developing effective interventions. Evidence is growing that addictive-like tendencies toward foods may contribute to obesity in some individuals. The Yale Food Addiction Scale (YFAS, YFAS 2.0) was developed to identify individuals with addictive-like eating behaviors. Diagnosing food addiction (FA) requires meeting a symptom threshold plus clinically significant impairment/distress (self-perceived), but the utility of the impairment/distress criteria remains controversial. This secondary analysis compared individuals who did not meet the FA symptom criteria, met the symptom, but not the impairment/distress criteria, and met both criteria. This secondary analysis of data from a randomized controlled pilot study involving 83 adults with overweight/obesity used descriptive statistics and Univariate ANOVAS to compare YFAS 2.0 and Weight and Lifestyle Inventory responses among the groups. Twenty-eight individuals did not meet the FA symptom criteria, 20 met the symptom, but not the impairment/distress criteria, and 35 met both criteria. Of the latter, 80.0% had severe, 8.6% had moderate, and 11.4% had mild FA. Age at onset of overweight was lower with severe than with mild FA (p = 0.023). The YFAS 2.0 identified a distinct group with severe FA and a group who met the FA symptom threshold, but not the impairment/distress criteria. Few participants perceived impairment/distress unless they endorsed ≥ 6 symptoms. Adding clinical interviews may aid in assessing impairment/distress and addictive-like eating behaviors, particularly in those meeting the FA symptom, but not the impairment/distress criteria.

It is a promising approach for improving participation in cardiac rehabilitation by enabling instant contact, hypermedia information delivery, technology-monitored functionalities and individualised progress monitoring. To evaluate the effects of a nurse-led eHealth cardiac rehabilitation (NeCR) system on health behaviours, cardiac self-efficacy, anxiety and depression, health-related quality of life, risk parameters and unplanned use of care services for people with coronary heart disease. A single-blinded randomised controlled trial design was used. The study randomly assigned 146 patients hospitalised for coronary heart disease to receive either the NeCR intervention or the usual care. Underpinned by social cognitive theory, the intervention commenced before hospital discharge with an in-person session by the nurse to identify individualised self-care needs, set goals and develop an action plan to enhance behavioural risk factor modification and orientate the patient to the use of the information and communication technology platform for cardiac rehabilitation. After discharge, the e-platform helped patients gain knowledge of disease management and monitor goal attainment for health behavioural changes. The nurse provided feedback on the patients' goal attainment and lifestyle modifications on a weekly basis in a small group format through the WeChat platform, thus also mobilising peer influence. Data for lifestyle behaviours, physiological risk parameters and clinical outcomes were collected at baseline and at 6 and 12 weeks post-intervention. At 6 weeks post-intervention, participants in the intervention group showed significant improvement in the number of steps/day (β = 2628.48, p = .022), the number of minutes/week sitting (β = -640.30, p = .006) and their health-promoting lifestyle profile (β = 25.17, p < .001) compared with the control group.

This study analyzed patient-therapist in-session interpersonal complementarity effects on the therapeutic alliance and depression severity during the initial and working phase of cognitive-behavioral therapy for depression. It also explored whether patients' interpersonal problems moderate those complementarity effects. We drew on a sample of 90 dyads derived from a randomized controlled trial of two cognitive-behavioral therapies for depression. Using an observer-based measure, we assessed patients' and therapists' interpersonal behavior in Sessions 1, 5, 9, and 13 and computed their complementarity regarding interpersonal affiliation (i.e., correspondence) and dominance (i.e., reciprocity). Patients completed measures of interpersonal problems at baseline and session-by-session measures of depression severity and quality of the therapeutic alliance. Response surface analyses based on polynomial regressions showed that patient-therapist complementarity in higher affiliative behaviors was associated with a stronger alliance. Interpersonal problems regarding agency moderated the complementarity effects of the dominance dimensions on depression severity. Overly dominant patients benefited more from a nonreciprocal relationship in the dominance dimension, whereas submissive patients benefited more from complementarity in that dimension. Furthermore, interpersonal problems of communion significantly moderated the effects of complementarity in affiliative behaviors on both the alliance and outcome. These results suggest the relevance of both interpersonal correspondence and reciprocity for the psychotherapy process, informing clinical practice in terms of interpersonal responsiveness. The moderation effects of interpersonal problems provide preliminary evidence, which should be replicated in future research, to determine relevant markers indicating for whom a complementary approach would be beneficial in cognitive therapy for depression.

Participants completed a semi-structured qualitative interview at the final visit, which provided information about the acceptability, benefits of intervention, and barriers to engagement. All participants (N = 10) reported that the intervention somewhat or completely met their expectations, demonstrating intervention acceptability. Intervention completers (n = 9) experienced reduced anxiety over the first 4 weeks, alongside significant improvements in anxiety control and personalized activity goals across 8 weeks. However, anxiety symptoms tended to return to baseline at follow-up.

Subjective quality of life is an important outcome of psychotic disorders. However, longitudinal course of subjective quality of life in the early illness stage is under-studied. We aimed to investigate the patterns and baseline predictors of subjective quality of life trajectories over 3 years in early psychosis patients, utilizing growth mixing modeling analysis, in the context of a 3-year follow-up of a randomized controlled trial comparing 1-year extension of early intervention with step-down psychiatric care for first-episode psychosis. One hundred sixty Chinese patients were recruited from specialized early intervention program for first-episode psychosis in Hong Kong after they had completed this 2-year early intervention service, and underwent 1-year randomized controlled trial as well as 2-year post-randomized controlled trial follow-up (i.e. 3-year follow-up). Assessments on premorbid adjustment, onset profile, psychopathology, functioning and treatment characteristics were conducted. Individual class membership of subjective quality of life trajectory derived from growth mixing modeling was based on the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey mental component summary scores measured at four different time-points (baseline, 1, 2 and 3 years) among 142 participants across 3-year follow-up.

Age of onset; duration of untreated psychosis; depressive, positive and negative symptoms; and intervention condition were significantly different between good (higher-improving trajectory) and poor (combined lower-stable and deteriorating trajectories) trajectory groups. Multiple regression analysis revealed that younger age of onset, more severe depression and receipt of step-down care independently predicted poor subjective quality of life trajectory. Approximately one-third of patients displayed poor subjective quality of life trajectory in the early phase of psychotic illness.

Older nursing home residents are often characterized by multimorbidity and dependency in activities of daily living. Most exercise studies in this setting aim at residents who are still able to walk despite the huge group of residents that is unable to walk. Thus, little is known about the effectiveness to improve cognitive and motor functions as well as well-being within this target group, e.g., by use of chair-based exercises. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of a 16-week multicomponent chair-based exercise intervention on motor functions, cognition and well-being for nursing home residents who are unable to walk. A two-arm single-blinded multicenter randomized controlled trial integrated N = 52 nursing home residents with a mean age of 81 ± 11 years (63% female), randomly assigned to a training (n = 26, 16 weeks; twice a week; 60 min) or a wait-list control group (n = 26). The intervention followed the F.I.T.T. principles (frequency, intensity, time and type) and was continuously adapted to residents' performance level. The outcomes motor function (hand grip strength, sitting balance, manual dexterity), cognitive performance (cognitive status, working memory) and psychosocial resources (physical and mental well-being (SF12), satisfaction with life (SWLS), depressive symptoms (CES-D)) were assessed at baseline (pre-test) and after 16-weeks (post-treatment). Statistics were performed using ANOVA for repeated measures. The results of the ANOVA showed significant improvements of the intervention group for hand grip strength (Pre: M = 12.67, SD = 5.28; Post: M = 13.86, SD = 4.79; Group × Time: F(1, 17) = 10.816, p = .002, ηp 2  = 0.241), manual dexterity (Pre: M = 4.50, SD = 5.17; Post: M = 5.30, SD = 4.25; Group × Time: F(1, 7) = 9.193, p = .008, ηp 2  = 0.365), cognition (Pre: M = 10.31, SD = 6.87; Post: M = 11.06, SD = 7.50; Group × Time: F(1, 15) = 12.687, p = .001, ηp 2  = 0.284), and depression (Pre: M = 5.19, SD = 5.12; Post: M = 4.38, SD = 4.62; Group × Time: F(1, 14) = 5.135, p = .031, ηp 2  = 0.150) while the values of the control group decreased. The multicomponent chair-based intervention over 16 weeks was able to improve motor functions and cognition in nursing home residents who are unable to walk.

Regarding clinical outcomes, patients with AUD who received active stimulation demonstrated a greater rate of improvement in depression symptoms than those without comorbid AUD. The presence of AUD did not impact PTSD symptom change. Limitations include a modest sample size and use of a categorical, rather than continuous, index of AUD diagnosis.

The Danish OPUS trial showed significant efficacy of early intervention services for first-episode schizophrenia spectrum disorders compared with standard treatment, leading to implementation of the OPUS intervention in clinical practice. The authors sought to determine whether the effectiveness of OPUS treatment in real-world clinical practice is comparable to the efficacy seen in the trial. The study compared patients who received OPUS treatment as part of the original randomized trial to those who received standard treatment in the trial (the control group) and those who received OPUS treatment after it was implemented in Denmark. The authors investigated whether the three groups differed on register-based outcomes, such as use of secondary health care, functional outcomes, and death. Analyses were adjusted for relevant confounders. Compared with trial study participants, patients who received OPUS treatment after implementation (N=3,328) had a tendency toward lower mortality (hazard ratio=0.60, 95% CI=0.33, 1.09), fewer and shorter psychiatric admissions, and possibly fewer filled prescriptions of antipsychotics and other psycholeptics after 4 or 5 years. While at first less likely to be working or studying, patients who received postimplementation OPUS treatment eventually had higher odds of working than did those in the OPUS trial (after 5 years, odds ratio=1.49, 95% CI=1.07, 2.09). The odds of being in a couple relationship were also higher among patients in the postimplementation group than those in the trial. Other outcomes showed less clear associations with treatment group. Generally, the control group in the trial fared worse than both of the OPUS treatment groups.

There were no differences in the 5-year overall survival rate (open vs. laparoscopic; 78.9% vs. 82.1%, p = 0.638), 5-year disease-free survival rate (70.5% vs. 62.8%, p = 0.276), 5-year recurrence-free survival rate (76.1% vs. 72.1%, p = 0.419), or 5-year cancer-specific survival rate (86.1% vs. 80.5%, p = 0.208). No differences in survival were detected in the analyses of stage and tumor location. There was no significant difference in the overall recurrence rate or recurrence site. However, distant lymph node metastases and local recurrences were more common after laparoscopic surgery than after open surgery. There was no difference in the cause of death. More than half of the patients died from other diseases in both groups (57.9% vs. 52.6%, p = 0.765). Laparoscopic surgery showed similar long-term results compared to open surgery in elderly patients with CRC.

We investigated the non-inferiority of continuous rectus sheath block to continuous epidural anesthesia for postoperative analgesia of gynecological cancer patients. One hundred ASA-PS 1-2 patients via a median incision up to 5 cm above the navel were randomized into a continuous epidural anesthesia (CEA) group and a continuous rectus sheath block (CRSB) group. Following surgery, they have controlled with intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (IV-PCA) as basal postoperative analgesia. For patients in the CEA group were administered 0.25% levobupivacaine at 5 mg/h. Patients in the CRSB group, catheters were inserted on both sides of the posterior rectus sheath after surgery. They received 0.25% levobupivacaine on both sides at 7.5 mg/h. To determine whether CRSB is non-inferior to CEA in postoperative treatment, pain at rest and movement was assessed using the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS). The non-inferiority margin of NRS difference between CRSB and CEA was set at 1.3 difference in means. The primary outcome was non-inferiority comparisons of NRS at rest/at movement after surgery, while the secondary outcome included the frequency of requesting IV-PCA and rescue drugs. NRS at rest in the CRSB group was not inferior to that in the CEA group. On the other hand, the NRS at movement at 4, 6, 8, 12 h following surgery in the CRSB group was inferior to CEA. There was no difference in the frequency of requesting IV-PCA and rescue drugs. CRSB showed the non-inferiority to CEA for postoperative analgesia at rest, while CRSB was not non-inferior to CEA at movement in gynecological cancer patients.

The treatment result of the uncovered metallic stent (uncovered MS) and covered metallic stent (covered MS) for unresectable malignant distal biliary obstruction is controversial. This time, we conducted this study to compare the efficacies and complication rates of uncovered MS and covered MS in unresectable malignant distal biliary obstructions at a prospective randomized multicenter trial. From April 2014 to September 2018, patients with unresectable malignant distal biliary obstruction were randomly assigned to 2 groups: the uncovered MS group and the covered MS group. 92 treatment results patients were discussed. 48 patients were assigned to the uncovered MS group and 44 cases were assigned to the covered MS group. Both groups showed a drainage effect. No significant difference was found in the drainage effect between the 2 groups. The number of stent occlusion was significantly greater (p = .0467) in uncovered MS (43.8%) comparing with those in covered MS (22.7%). As the cause of stent occlusion, tumor ingrowth was significantly greater (p < .001) in the uncovered MS group (35.4%) than in the covered MS group (2.3%).

Premature ventricular contraction (PVC) as one of the most common arrhythmias could worsen the morbidity of cardiovascular events, particularly concurrent with other risk factors. Considering the probable side effects of antiarrhythmic drugs chronic use, prescribing herbal medicines for such conditions is on the rise. Melissa officinalis (MO) is widely identified as an antiarrhythmic and cardioprotective agent but there is limited evidence for its clinical use. This research, thus, aimed to investigate the effects of MO tea among patients with PVCs. The present 12-week randomised controlled trial enrolled 60 patients with confirmed diagnosis of moderate to low-grade PVCs. The patients in intervention group received MO teabags (containing 2-g dried leaves/250 mL in hot water) two times/day in addition to lifestyle modification recommendations, while control group only received lifestyle modification recommendations. After collecting the data, blood samples were gathered to explore serum concentrations of glucose and lipid markers. The number of premature ventricular beats and heart rates was determined by 24-hour rhythm Holter monitoring. On average, the patients aged 47 years and approximately 67.8% (n = 40) were women. The ANCOVA adjusted for baseline values and confounders revealed that patients in the MO tea group had significantly lower concentrations of triglyceride (adjusted mean (AM) = 144.75 mg/dL), total cholesterol (AM = 155.35 mg/dL), and fasting blood sugar (AM = 90.85 mg/dL), compared with the controls (AM = 174.27, 171.99, 99.84 mg/dL, respectively (P-value ≤.042). However, the intervention failed to affect LDL-C and HDL-C levels significantly. Significantly reduced frequency of 24-hour premature ventricular beats in the MO tea group (AM = 2142.39) was also noted compared with the controls (AM = 3126.05); (P-value = .017). The 24-hour heartbeats showed only a significant decrease within the intervention group (P-value < .01).
